    title1: `Acrobatic Gymnastics`,
    title2: `acrobatic gymnastics`,
    desc1: `Acrobatic gymnastics is a competitive discipline of gymnastics where partnerships of gymnasts work together and perform figures consisting of acrobatic moves, dance and tumbling, set to music. There are three types of routines; a 'balance' routine (at FIG grade 5 and above) where the focus is on strength, poise and flexibility; a 'dynamic' routine (also FIG grade 5 and above) which includes throws, somersaults and catches, and (at FIG grade 6 and above, as well as grade 4 and below) a 'combined' routine which includes elements from both balance and dynamic.`,

    desc2: `The first use of acrobatics as a specific sport was in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, and the first world championships were in 1974.[2]

    In addition to the current five categories, two additional categories for tumbling (men's and women's) were included until the 1999 World Championships, though some groups still involve tumbling events.[3]
    
    In the United States, the first national sports acrobatics organization was called the United States Sports Acrobatics Federation (USSAF). Founded in 1975, its name was changed to the United States Sports Acrobatics (USSA) in the 1990s. The USSA then merged with USA Gymnastics in 2002, and Acrobatic Gymnastics is now a discipline therein.[4]`,

    desc3: `Acrobatic gymnastics involves routines performed by pairs or groups with defined roles. Competitions are scored based on execution, artistry, and difficulty, with safety being a priority. Athletes compete in age categories, wear appropriate costumes, and choose their own music. The sport follows rules set by national and international governing bodies, and athletes progress through various competition levels, showcasing a blend of strength, flexibility, and creativity in their routines.`,

    desc4: `The acrobatic gymnastics competitions are judged on a score out of 30.00. The following are the categories in which the athletes are scored.

    an artistic component which evaluates the acrobats performance in terms of choreography, diversity, and ability to perform to the music; (scored out of 10)
    an execution component which evaluates the deductions incurred by the acrobats while performing the partner and individual skills of the routine (for example, bent legs or unpointed toes). This is scored out of 10, but then later doubled to emphasize its importance.
    a difficulty component which is the overall equivalent score based on the degree of difficulty and number of skills (the difficulty score is determined by the value allocated to skills according to the Code of Points).
    Scores over thirty are not uncommon, as difficulty points are not limited. For Senior Elites the difficulty has no cap, meaning that they can exceed 30.00 by having a lot of difficulty.`,

    desc5: `Acrobatic Gymnastics is part of the World Games, and are also included in the European Games as well as having a dedicated Acrobatic Gymnastics World Championships held in even numbered years (known as World Sports Acrobatics Championships prior to 2006), and continental or region championships in odd numbered years. For example, the 28th Acrobatic Gymnastics European Championships were held in Rzeszow, Poland in October 2017.

    There are also numerous national, state, and regional competitions that are held in each country. Local and regional competitions often form the qualification stages required to compete at national championships. There is no requirement from the FIG for gymnasts to have qualified through their own national championships to compete internationally, but local governing bodies will often make their national team selections based on performance at national competition.`,

    title1: `Alpine Skiing`,
    title2: `alpine skiing`,
    desc1: `Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the pastime of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis with fixed-heel bindings, unlike other types of skiing (cross-country, Telemark, or ski jumping), which use skis with free-heel bindings. Whether for recreation or for sport, it is typically practiced at ski resorts, which provide such services as ski lifts, artificial snow making, snow grooming, restaurants, and ski patrol.`,
    desc2: `Alpine skiing, as we know it today, evolved over time and was not the result of a single invention. It has roots in the skiing traditions of the Scandinavian countries and the mountainous regions of Europe. These regions have a long history of using skis for transportation and hunting. Modern Alpine skiing, with its focus on downhill racing and recreational skiing, began to take shape in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the Alpine regions of Europe, particularly in countries like Norway, Austria, and Switzerland. Pioneers and enthusiasts in these regions contributed to the development of the sport, leading to the establishment of organized ski clubs and competitions. The first ski races and downhill events marked the early stages of Alpine skiing's emergence as a popular and competitive winter sport. While no single individual can be credited with the invention of Alpine skiing, it is the result of the collective efforts and cultural practices of these mountainous regions over time.`,
    desc3: `Alpine skiing, a sport focused on downhill racing and recreational skiing, developed over time in Alpine regions of Europe, influenced by Scandinavian skiing traditions. No single inventor is credited with its creation, but pioneers in countries like Norway, Austria, and Switzerland contributed to its development. The sport's evolution involved the establishment of ski clubs, races, and downhill events, shaping modern Alpine skiing.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in Alpine skiing is based on the fastest time to complete a downhill course. Skiers are awarded points based on their time relative to the winner, with the fastest time earning the most points. Penalties or disqualifications can be incurred for missing gates or straying from the designated course. The skier with the highest total points wins the competition.`,
    desc5: `Alpine skiing has been a part of the Winter Olympic Games since the first Winter Olympics in 1936. The sport consists of several disciplines, including downhill, slalom, giant slalom, super-G (super giant slalom), and combined events. Both men and women compete in these disciplines, and medals are awarded for each. Alpine skiing is a prominent and highly anticipated event in the Winter Olympics, attracting top athletes from around the world to compete for medals and national pride.`,

    title1: "Archery",
    title2: `archery`,
    decs1: `Archery is one of the oldest sports still practised, and is closely linked to the development of civilisation. Using bows and arrows, the sport as a history dating back thousands of years. As a cultural advance, it was comparable to the discovery of fire and the invention of the wheel.`,

    decs2: `Archery was the favourite sport of the Egyptian pharaohs during the 18th dynasty (1567-1320 BC). Many centuries later, some of the earliest recorded archery tournaments took place during the Zhou dynasty (1046 - 256 BC) in China. Such events were attended by Chinese nobility. Much later, English writers honoured the longbow for famous contributions to their country’s victories in the battles of Crécy, Agincourt and Poitiers.

    In 1200 BC, the Hittites and Assyrians shot their bows from chariots, becoming fearsome opponents in battle. They made their bows with tendon, horn and wood, and also developed a new re-curved shape. This made their bows shorter and more powerful, making them easier to handle for an archer on horseback.`,

    decs3: `That depends on the type of archery being practised as sport, with different disciplines and rules regarding the type of bow that can be used. At the Olympics, outdoor target archery is practised with recurve bows. This sees athletes fire at targets 70 metres away, with competitors going head-to-head to win set points (with 2 points for winning a set or 1 point for tying a set), with the first to 6 set points winning the match. Other types of archery for sport include field archery, indoor archery, and para archery. Other bows that may be used include a compound bow or a barebow.`,

    decs4: `Each arrow can score from 0 to 10 points, with 10 points for hitting the smallest rings of the target. If the arrow is touching a line separating two scoring zones, the higher score counts. There is often also an inner-most ring, which also awards 10 points but is used as a tie-breaker if needed. After each set of three arrows per competitor, the archer with more points wins the set and picks up 2 set points in the match.`,

    decs5: `Archery first appeared in the Olympic Games in 1900, was contested again in 1904, 1908, and 1920, then again—after an absence of 52 years—from 1972 to the present. The most decorated archer in Olympic history is Hubert Van Innis of Belgium, who competed in 1900 and 1920, winning six gold and three silver medals.

    Currently, five events are on the archery programme at each Olympic Games: men's and women's individual and team events, and a mixed team event.`,

    title1: `Artistic Gymnastics`,
    title2: `artistic gymnastics`,
    desc1: `Introduced in 1894, artistic gymnastics was one of the original disciplines in the modern Olympic Games. Artistic gymnasts are challenged to perfect their skills across a range of equipment, such as the beam and performing on the floor.`,
    desc2: `Plato, Aristotle, and Homer heartily advocated the strengthening qualities of gymnastic activity. The Ancient Greek civilisation more than two thousand years ago believed symmetry between the mind and body was possible only when physical exercise was coupled with intellectual activity.

    The term "artistic gymnastics" emerged in the early 1800s to distinguish free-flowing styles from techniques used in military training. Gymnastic competitions began to flourish in schools and athletic clubs across Europe, and made a fitting return at the first edition of the modern Olympic Games were revived in Athens in 1896.
    
    Between 1896 and 1924 the sport evolved into what we recognise as modern gymnastics. Among those disciplines discarded were club swinging, rock lifting and even swimming, which appeared in 1922.
    
    In the early days of artistic gymnastics at the Games, participants often had a background in ballet, and would reach their peak in their 20s. Nadia Comaneci’s and Nelli Kim's perfect scores of 10 at the 1976 Montreal Games, at the age of 14, heralded an era of younger champions, trained specifically in gymnastics from childhood, although gymnasts must now be 16 to compete in the Olympic Games.`,
    desc3: `Artistic gymnastics features gymnasts performing routines on various apparatus, with specific rules for each. Routines are judged for execution, artistry, and difficulty, with deductions for errors. A Code of Points, established by the FIG, governs the sport, outlining skill difficulty and scoring potential. Gymnasts aim to execute routines with precision and flair, adhering to strict rules for skill composition, technique, and form throughout their performances.`,
    desc4: `Gymnasts are awarded a D score for difficulty and an E score for execution.

    The difficulty score is based on the performed moves, earning between 0.1 and 1.0 points per move.
    The top eight moves are counted for women, and top 10 for men, to give them their final D score.
    For the vault, it’s simply the score associated with the vault move.
    For their E score, every gymnast starts with the perfect 10.0 score, with points deducted for any mistakes.
    The gymnast with the highest combined D and E score wins.
    The gymnast with the highest combined score from all events wins the all-around event.`,
    desc5: `Artistic gymnastics was introduced at the very first Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens, and has been present at every edition of the Games since then. At the beginning, it comprised disciplines that are difficult to qualify as “artistic”, such as climbing and acrobatics.

    The foundations of the Olympic gymnastics programme were laid at the 1924 Games in Paris, when the men’s apparatus individual and team competitions appeared. In 1928, women were included in the Amsterdam Games. It was not until 1952 that the women’s programme was developed, with seven events, and then stabilised at six events as from the 1960 Games in Rome.`,

    title1: `Artistic Swimming`,
    title2: `artistic swimming`,
    desc1: `Artistic swimming, formerly known as synchronised swimming, is a relatively new discipline with its origins in water acrobatics.`,
    desc2: `Originally known as water ballet, the pastime was first practised in the late 19th century with the first recorded competition held in the German capital Berlin in 1891.

    At the start of the 20th century, Australian swimmer Annette Kellerman helped popularise the sport when she toured the United States performing water acrobatics.
    
    The sport was developed further by Katherine Curtis who had the idea of combining water acrobatics with music. Her students performed at the 1933-34 Chicago 'Century of Progress' Fair, where the announcer, former Olympic swimming gold medallist Norman Ross, coined the term "synchronised swimming".`,
    desc3: `Artistic swimming routines consist of a variety of moves including 'figures' (leg movements), arm sections, and lifts (also known as highlights). Swimmers must not touch the bottom of the pool and scull or use advanced methods of treading water to avoid doing so. They must also not be out of the water for more than 10 seconds.

    There are two types of routines - free routines and technical routines where a number of specified elements must be performed.
    
    Following scoring system changes made in October 2022, there are now two judging panels - five judges assessing elements and five artistic impression. There are also three technical controllers scoring difficulty, and three more observing synchronisation.
    
    Coaches must now indicate the elements in their athletes' routines in advance which are given a degree of difficulty.`,
    desc4: `In Olympic artistic swimming, teams and duets are scored based on two routines: the technical routine and the free routine. The technical routine comprises predetermined elements, figures, and movements, evaluated for precision and synchronization. The free routine allows for artistic expression and creativity, incorporating acrobatic movements, choreography, and music. Judges assess execution, synchronization, and artistic impression to determine scores. These scores are then combined to determine the final rankings in the competition.`,
    desc5: `Synchronised swimming was a demonstration sport at the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki, but did not become a full Olympic sport until Los Angeles 1984 when medals were awarded in women's duet and women's solo.

    The women's team event was introduced at Atlanta 1996 at the expense of the other two synchro disciplines but, from Sydney 2000 onwards, there have been team and duet competitions.
    
    Tokyo 2020 in 2021 was the first Games where the sport was known as artistic swimming.
    
    The United States and Canada were initially the top nations in Olympic synchronised swimming but Russia (and ROC at Tokyo 2020) has dominated since 2000, winning every gold medal on offer in duet and team events.
    
    Men will be able to compete in artistic swimming for the first time at Paris 2024 with up to two permitted per NOC in the eight-person team event.`,

    title2: `athletics`,
    desc1: `Athletics is a sport that includes a number of events involving running, jumping, throwing or walking. Often referred to as track & field, the sport includes single events, such as the 100m, marathon or long jump, combined events, including the decathlon and heptathlon, or team-based events such as the 4x100m relays.`,
    desc2: `While athletics has been practised throughout history, the first ever event contested at the ancient Olympic Games was the “stadium” race, a sprint of about 192 metres. Winners in this event have been recorded from as far back as 776 BC.`,
    desc3: `Athletics, a diverse sport that encompasses track and field events, has a set of general rules and guidelines. Competitors must adhere to their specific event's rules, such as running or throwing regulations, including starting commands for sprint events and field dimensions. Athletes must respect the designated lanes, avoid lane infringement, and perform within specified zones. Disqualifications or fouls may result from rule violations. Athletes' equipment must meet standards, and anti-doping regulations are enforced. Timing and measurement devices ensure accurate results, and judges monitor compliance. In relay events, baton exchanges follow set rules. The rules are established and enforced by international and national athletics governing bodies.`,
    desc4: `Athletics competitions, including track and field events, are scored based on various methods, but the primary determinant is performance. In running events, the fastest time wins, while in field events, the farthest distance or highest height clears the bar wins. Decathlon and heptathlon use a points system where each performance earns points based on performance standards, and the athlete with the most points wins. Team events like relay races are scored by the order of finish. Scoring may vary depending on the specific event and competition, but ultimately, the objective is to achieve the best performance or result to secure victory or high placement.`,
    desc5: `The ancient Olympic Games included a number of athletics events that sports fans today would recognise including running, long jump, shot put and javelin. By the time of the first modern Olympic Games at Athens 1896, athletics was once again one of the main features of the programme, with track events ranging from 100m to 1500m, the marathon, and field events such as long jump and pole vault. At Tokyo 2020, athletes competed in 26 events - the same number that is on the programme for Paris 2024.`,

    title2: `badminton`,
    desc1: `Badminton is a racket-and-shuttle game played on a court by two players or doubles teams. The sport takes its name from Badminton House—home of the Duke of Beaufort in the English county of Gloucestershire.`,
    desc2: `n 1873, the Duke is credited with bringing a version of the game—Poona—back from India and introducing it to his guests.

    The sport quickly grew in popularity, and in 1877, the first set of written rules were devised by the newly formed Bath Badminton Club. The Badminton Federation of England was created 16 years later, and in 1899, it organised the first All England Championships.`,
    desc3: `The exact rules of badminton have changed over time, but the aim is to land the shuttle in-bounds in the opponent's half of the court without the opponent returning it successfully. Matches are currently played to a best-of-three games, with the first to 21 points winning each game. Each player or doubles team must win each game by two clear points, except if a game reaches 29–all, a single sudden-death point is played.`,
    desc4: `Badminton is played with a scoring system based on rally points. Each game is played to 21 points, and a player or team must win by a margin of at least two points. In the event of a 20-20 tie, the game continues until one side has a two-point advantage. In doubles play, the serving side must win a rally to earn a point. The server's side can win or lose points, while in singles, the server can only earn or lose points. Each game consists of a maximum of 30 points. Matches are typically best of three games, with the first side to win two games emerging as the winner. In mixed doubles, the server's gender determines which service court they use. Badminton scoring is straightforward and emphasizes precision, agility, and strategy in the game.`,
    desc5: `Badminton made its debut as a demonstration sport at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. It was not until the 1992 Games in Barcelona that it was officially included on the Olympic programme, with men’s and women’s singles and doubles events. The mixed doubles event made its debut in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympic Games. Since then, the number of events has remained unchanged.`,

    title2: `baseball softball`,
    desc1: `Baseball and softball are two related ball sports played between two teams on a diamond-shaped field.`,
    desc2: `The earliest record of the game of "baseball" being played was in Surrey, England, in 1749. The sport made it to the United States by the 1770s, and the first organised professional league—the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players—was founded in 1875. Baseball is considered "America's past-time".

    Softball was first imagined as “indoor baseball” in 1887 in Chicago, Illinois, by reporter George Hancock after watching someone hit a boxing glove with a broom handle. He went on to publish rules for the game and later took it outside, playing on fields too small for baseball. While the rules remained vague, interest in the game grew, and more than 100 area high school teams were formed by 1892.
    
    In 1895, firefighters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, played a similar game named “kitten ball” using a ball of yarn wrapped in leather. In 1907, a guide for indoor baseball published by Albert Spalding allowed for game flexibility with two constants: a larger ball than baseball as well as underhand pitching. In 1926, Walter Hakanson proposed unifying the disparate versions of the game into one, under a single name: Softball.`,
    desc3: `Two teams of nine players aim to score the most runs by striking a ball and running round a sequence of bases to reach the home plate.

    The teams rotate between batting and fielding, with each session called an inning, and switch when the fielding team gets three opposition players out.
    
    The pitcher throws the ball from a mound toward the catcher which the batter attempts to hit and get around the bases to the home plate.
    
    Softball is similar but features 9 or 10 players per team, depending on the style being played. The basic rules are the same.`,
    desc4: `In baseball and softball, scoring is based on runs. Teams alternate between batting and fielding. A run is scored when a player successfully rounds all the bases and returns to home plate. The team with the most runs at the end of the specified number of innings or time limit wins. Pitchers aim to prevent the batter from reaching base by striking them out or forcing them to make an out by fielding the ball. In both sports, hits, walks, and defensive plays impact the score. Extra-base hits and home runs earn additional runs. Games can vary in length, with baseball typically consisting of nine innings, and softball games often lasting seven innings.`,
    desc5: `Baseball featured several times on the Olympic programme as a demonstration sport before being included as a medal event at the Olympic Games Barcelona 1992.

    Cuba won the gold medal on the sport’s competitive debut and three times in total before it was removed from the programme following the Olympic Games Beijing 2008.
    
    Softball was introduced at the Olympic Games Atlanta 1996 as a women-only medal sport, with the United States winning the sport’s inaugural gold medal. They won the subsequent two titles and enjoyed a 22-game winning streak from September 2000 before they were beaten by Japan in the final in 2008.
    
    Originally considered separate sports at the Olympics, baseball softball made its return as a combined sport with two distinct events (men's baseball and women's softball) at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, where hosts Japan won both gold medals.`,

    title2: `basketball`,
    desc1: `Basketball is a team sport played on a rectangular court where two opposing teams made up of five players attempt to score by throwing a ball into the opponent's hoop and net, otherwise known as a basket.`,
    desc2: `Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Canadian James W. Naismith, an instructor at the YMCA Training School in Massachusetts.

    Naismith sought a suitable indoor game to keep his students fit and warm during the cold New England winters. He formulated 13 rules, most of which still apply today.
    
    In 1893, the first women’s game was played at the Smith College, in Northampton, Massachusetts, USA.
    
    Originally, basketball was played with peach baskets, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each score. A hole was then drilled into the bottom of the basket, allowing the balls to be poked out with a long rod. In 1906, the peach baskets were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards.
    
    Another element of the original game was that a soccer ball was initially used before switching to a dedicated brown ball. In the late 1950s Tony Hinkle, searching for an alternative that would be more visible to players and spectators introduced an orange ball which grew to become an icon feature of the game.`,
    desc3: `Basketball is played by two opposing teams made up of five players on an indoor court.

    To win the game a team must score more field goals than the other team which is done when a player shoots the ball through the opposition’s basket. Teams have a limited amount of time (24 seconds) to shoot the ball during a given possession. If the time elapses, the team in possession must give up the ball and become the team in defence.
    
    Players control the ball with their hands but may only advance the ball by passing or dribbling (bouncing the ball on the floor). If a player stops dribbling, then they can’t resume dribbling. They then must pass the ball or shoot it. A ‘travelling’ violation, resulting in a turnover, is issued if a player runs while holding the ball without dribbling. The ball and ballhandler must remain inside the court during gameplay. If a player steps out of bounds of touches the line with their foot while in possession of the ball, a turnover will be issued.
    
    Field goals are worth a different number of points depending on where the goal is shot from. Baskets shot from inside the arc that denotes the three-point line on the rectangular court are worth two points. Baskets \\ shot from outside the arc are worth three points.*
    
    One point can be accumulated through free throws, which are worth a point shot. Free throws are awarded to a team when the opposition team fouls.
    
    Illegal physical contact or obstructions without the intention of winning the ball by a defender when an offensive player is aiming to shoot is regarded as a foul.
    
    Defenders must try and regain possession and can do so by blocking or stealing the ball. However, they can’t intefere with a shot while it is on its downward trajectory into the basket. Another thing for defenders to be aware of is that they can’t stay longer than three seconds inside ‘the paint’ which is a zone directly in front of the basket. The same rule applies to an offensive player. If someone has spent three seconds in the paint, they must most out of the space before they can return.`,
    desc4: `An international basketball game is typically made up of 10-minute quarters meaning a game will last 40 minutes. This is different to the NBA where quarters are 12 minutes. Another point of difference is the length and number of timeouts. For the Games, all timeouts are one-minute long and each team gets two timeouts in the first half and then three in second with just one in overtime.

    If the score is tied after four quarters, an overtime period of five minutes is played. The teams continue playing overtime periods until one team wins.`,
    desc5: `Basketball made its first Olympic appearance in 1904 in St Louis as a demonstration sport before the men’s event was formally introduced at the Olympic Games in 1936 in Berlin.

    Women’s basketball was later added to the programme at the 1976 Games in Montreal.
    
    The United States has historically dominated international basketball, and this was reflected at the Games with the nation winning all the men’s titles up to 1972, the year it was defeated by the Soviet Union at the Munich Games.
    
    In the women’s event, the Soviets took gold in 1976, 1980 and 1992, before the Americans rose to prominence winning all titles from 1984 to 2020, except in 1992.
    
    In 1992 at the Barcelona Games, professional players from the National Basketball Association (NBA) were allowed for the first time to represent their national teams. In the United States, the 1992 team became known as the “Dream Team” in the international media and was widely held to be the best basketball team ever formed. It delighted the public and widely dominated the Olympic tournament in 1992.
    
    Since then, professional players have continued to be allowed to play.
    
    Since Tokyo 2020 in 2021, a second basketball competition, 3x3 has been contested as an Olympic sport. More details on 3x3 are here`,

    desc1: `Beach handball is a variant of the traditional team sport of handball, adapted for play on sandy beaches. It is a fast-paced, dynamic sport where two teams compete to score goals by throwing a ball into the opponent's goal. The game is typically played in two sets, and each set is further divided into two halves. Teams consist of four outfield players and a goalkeeper. Beach handball emphasizes agility, speed, and skill, with players often performing acrobatic and stylish moves. It is known for its entertaining and spectator-friendly nature and is governed by the International Handball Federation (IHF), with its own set of rules and regulations. Beach handball has gained popularity in various beachside locations around the world and is a fun, casual form of the traditional handball game.`,
    desc2: `In the late 1980s, Italian coach Simonetta Montagni began developing handball on the beach. As the discipline began to grow in popularity, coach Luciano Bartolini was asked to create the first set of rules for the game in 1990, making the fast-paced game fit within the existing beach volleyball court lines.

    In 2000, beach handball became an official European Handball Federation (EHF) sport, and the first EHF Beach Handball European Championship was held that year in Gaeta, Italy. The sport was further developed with representatives of the International Handball Federation (IHF), and it began to reach a global audience. In 2004, the first Beach Handball World Championship was held in Egypt, and the first IHF under-17 World Championships were held in Mauritius in 2017. There, Spain won the men’s event and Hungary claimed the women’s gold.`,

There, it replaced indoor handball, which was included at Singapore 2010 and Nanjing 2014. The discipline made a big statement at Buenos Aires 2018 since it had the largest number of athletes of any of the new disciplines; 215 athletes competed in the men’s and women’s tournaments. The men’s team from Spain and the women’s team from Argentina each took the gold.`,

    desc1: `Olympic beach volleyball is a team sport played by two players on each side of a sand court divided by a net. The objective of the game is to hit the ball – with hands or arms only – over the net into the opponents’ court until the other side is unable to return the ball or the ball heads outside of the court lines. Each rally secures one point`,
    desc2: `Beach volleyball is a variant of the indoor version, invented in 1895 by American gym teacher William G Morgan.

    The first recorded game of beach volleyball was at the Outrigger Canoe Club on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii in 1915, when coach and club captain George Center set up a net on the sand and brought out a volleyball to entertain the club members on a day when there was no surf.
    
    The modern two-player game originated in Santa Monica, California in 1920 when a large sandy recreational area, created for public enjoyment, sowed the seed for beach volleyball.`,
    desc3: `The ball is put in play with a serve from behind the baseline, much like tennis, but using hands and arms, not racquets.

    Each side has up to three touches to return the ball to the opponents’ half with the rally continuing until a team cannot get the ball back, the ball goes out, or there is a fault in attempting to return the ball, such as hitting the net with any part of the body.
    
    Games are determined by the best of three sets — the first two are played to 21 points, and the third, if needed, to 15. A team needs to be ahead by two points to win a set. If the set is tied at 21-21, play continues until one team leads by two, for example, 23-21.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in beach volleyball follows a rally-point system, where points are awarded on every play, regardless of which team served. A match is typically played to 21 points, and a team must win by at least two points. If the match reaches 20-20, play continues until one team has a two-point lead. Each team serves alternately, and a point is awarded when the ball hits the sand within the opponent's court boundaries or if the opponent commits a fault. The first team to reach 21 points (with a minimum two-point advantage) wins the set, and a standard match is typically a best-of-three sets. The third set, if necessary, is played to 15 points. In beach volleyball, the scoring system adds to the intensity and excitement of the game.`,
    desc5: `A demonstration sport at Barcelona 1992, beach volleyball officially joined the ranks of Olympic sports at Atlanta 1996. There are both men’s and women’s editions.

    The venue for the Paris 2024 tournament will be the Eiffel Tower.`,

    title2: `biathlon`,
    desc1: `Biathlon combines the power and aggression of cross-country skiing with the precision and calm of marksmanship.`,
    desc2: `Biathlon was first developed as a military training exercise in Scandinavian countries during the late 19th century and later evolved into a competitive sport. In a standard biathlon competition, athletes ski over a specified distance with a rifle strapped to their back. At intervals along the skiing course, they stop at a shooting range to demonstrate their marksmanship skills by shooting at a series of targets. There are different formats of biathlon races, such as sprint, pursuit, individual, and relay events.`,
    desc3: `In 1948, the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon (UIPMB) was founded to standardise the rules for biathlon and pentathlon. In 1993, the biathlon branch of the UIPMB created the International Biathlon Union (IBU), which officially separated from the UIPMB in 1998.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in biathlon is based on a combination of time and accuracy. Athletes receive penalty seconds for missed shots during the shooting segments of the race. In most formats, each missed shot results in a time penalty, typically adding a fixed amount of time (e.g., 60 seconds) to the athlete's total race time. The athlete with the fastest overall time, including any time penalties, is the winner. So, in biathlon, both skiing speed and marksmanship play crucial roles in determining the final score.`,
    desc5: `In 1924 in Chamonix, an ancient form of biathlon made its Olympic debut: the military patrol. This event was then in demonstration in 1928, 1936 and 1948. After some attempts to incorporate it into a winter pentathlon, biathlon appeared at the Games in its current form in 1960 in Squaw Valley. Women’s biathlon made its first appearance on the Olympic programme in Albertville in 1992.

    Until the 1976 Games in Innsbruck, the events comprised an individual race and a relay. In Lake Placid in 1980, a second individual event was introduced.
    
    In Salt Lake City in 2002, a 12.5km pursuit event was added for men and 10km for women. From Turin in 2006, a new mass-start event was introduced for both men and women. This brings together the 30 best athletes from the World Cup.`,

    desc1: `Bobsleigh is a winter sport invented by the Swiss in the late 1860s, in which teams make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered sled.`,
    desc2: `The sport of bobsleigh didn't begin until the late 19th century, when the Swiss attached two skeleton sleds together and added a steering mechanism to make a toboggan. A chassis was added to give protection to wealthy tourists, and the world's first bobsleigh club was founded in St. Moritz, Switzerland in 1897.`,
    desc3: `Bobsleigh is a winter sport in which teams of two or four athletes make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, ice tracks in a gravity-powered sled. The teams take turns as both the pilot (responsible for steering) and the pusher (responsible for generating speed during the start). The sled with the fastest cumulative time over multiple runs wins. Bobsleigh is all about precision, speed, and teamwork, with strict rules regarding sled weight, dimensions, and equipment. Safety measures, including helmets and safety harnesses, are also mandatory.`,
    desc4: `In bobsleigh, scoring is determined by the total time it takes a team to complete multiple runs down the course. The team with the fastest cumulative time wins. There are no subjective scoring criteria; it's purely based on the clock. Teams strive to navigate the course with precision and maximize their speed to achieve the shortest overall time.`,
    desc5: `In 1924, a four-man race took place at the first ever Olympic Winter Games in Chamonix. A two-man event was added at the 1932 Lake Placid Games in a format that has remained to the present. The first women's bobsleigh event—the two-woman bobsled —was held in 2002. At the Winter Youth Olympic Games Lillehammer 2016, monobob had its Olympic debut. In the new solo discipline, athletes use a bob that is identical to those of all their competitors, giving pride of place to the driving, with the value of the equipment having no bearing. The women’s event is now on the programme of Beijing 2022.`,

    title2: `boxing`,
    desc1: `Boxing is a form of hand-to-hand unarmed combat where one athlete attempts to land punches on the head or body (above waist-height) of the opponent to score points - as decided by judges - or render said opponent unable to continue.`,
    desc2: `While the earliest evidence of boxing dates back to Ancient Egypt in around 3000 BC, it was not until the 16th century that 'prizefighting' or bare-knuckle boxing began to spring up, largely in Great Britain.

    In 1867, the Marquess of Queensberry rules were published which codified boxing for the first time and mandated the use of boxing gloves.`,
    desc3: `Boxing takes place in a 'ring' - a squared circle with sides between 4.9m and 7.3m in length and ropes between the four corners - attached to an elevated canvas mat.

    The two boxers face each other over a number of rounds which usually last three minutes. A referee controls the action and can stop the bout if they deem one boxer unable to continue. They can also suspend proceedings temporarily to allow cuts to be attended or equipment to be adjusted.
    
    If one boxer is punched to the floor, it is called a knockdown and the referee starts a count to 10. If the boxer fails to beat the count, they are knocked out. The referee can also award a standing eight count if they feel a boxer has taken a sufficiently hard punch to require a break.
    
    Judges score each round separately with 10 points going to the boxer they feel has had the better of proceedings in terms of the power and accuracy of their punches although aggression is also often rewarded. The loser of the round usually scores nine points, but this can be eight if the winner has been particularly dominant or scored a knockdown. If the contest goes the distance, the scorecards will decide who has won.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in boxing is typically based on a 10-point must system, where the boxer who wins a round is awarded 10 points, and their opponent receives a lower score. Judges consider various factors, including clean and effective punching, defense, ring generalship, and aggression when determining the round winner. If a round is closely contested, both boxers may receive 10 points. The boxer with the most points at the end of the match is declared the winner, often by a unanimous decision or, if it's a close match, a split decision. Knockdowns can lead to a 10-8 round in favor of the boxer who scored the knockdown, and if a boxer is knocked down twice in a round, it's usually scored as a 10-7 round. In cases of disqualification or other rule violations, point deductions may be applied.`,
    desc5: `Boxing made its Olympic debut at St. Louis 1904 and has featured at every Games since except Stockholm 1912 due to the sport being illegal in Sweden at that time.

    Women's boxing was introduced at London 2012 with just three weight classes, although that number has gradually increased with men's weight classes reduced.
    
    Cuba and the United States are the historical powerhouses of Olympic boxing with Great Britain and Russia also known for their strength in the sport. Britain, Ireland and the United States have so far enjoyed the most success in women's Olympic boxing.`,

    Canoe sprint, originally known as flatwater canoe, is the original and simplest form of the sport where an athlete wins by reaching the finish first.`,
    desc3: `Up to eight individual athletes (or crews) line up for a sprint canoe or sprint kayak race with each allocated lanes they must stay within.

    And then, simply, they must reach the finish line as quickly as possible.`,
    desc4: `In canoe flatwater, the scoring is straightforward and is based on time. Competitors race against the clock to complete a specific distance, typically 200 meters, 500 meters, or longer distances in some cases. The fastest time wins, and there are no subjective scoring criteria involved. Penalties can be added to a competitor's time for infractions such as missing a gate or buoy in slalom events, but in flatwater events, it is primarily about achieving the fastest time to secure victory.`,
    desc5: `Under its former name of flatwater canoeing, canoe sprint featured at the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris as a demonstration sport. It became a full Olympic discipline for the first time at Berlin 1936.

    There have been a number of changes to events over the years with women first competing at London 1948 but only in kayaks. It was not until Tokyo 2020 that women could race for medals in sprint canoes.
    
    Race distances have been reduced over time to appeal more to audiences with Olympic races now taking place over 200m (only women C-1), 500m, and 1000m (only men C-1 and K-1).

    New for Paris 2024 is extreme kayak where, instead of the usual individual challenge against the clock, four athletes race against each other on a shortened course.`,
    desc2: `Canoe slalom was founded in Switzerland in the early 1930s as a summer alternative to slalom skiing although initial races were on flatwater rather than whitewater courses.`,
    desc3: `In the traditional time challenge, courses are designed so leading athletes will complete them in between 90 and 110 seconds. The time penalty for touching a gate is two seconds, while missing a gate incurs a hefty 50-second sanction.

    In extreme kayak, also known as kayak cross, the four competitors slide off a start ramp more than two metres above the water and from there it's a race to the first buoy and almost anything goes. Contact with gates and other boats is permitted although missing a gate - or not performing a kayak roll somewhere on the course - results in disqualification.`,
    desc4: `Canoe slalom scoring is based on time and penalties. Competitors aim to navigate a challenging river course as quickly as possible. Penalties, often in the form of time additions, are given for touching or missing gates. The competitor with the fastest total time, including penalties, is the winner.`,
    desc5: `Canoe slalom was first included as a medal event at the 1972 Munich Games and was not seen at the Olympic Games again until Barcelona 1992.

    Up until Rio 2016 there were four events: men's C-1 canoe, K-1 kayak and C-2 canoe (men's pair), and women's K-1 kayak. At Tokyo 2020, the men's C-2 was replaced by the first Olympic women's C-1 competition.

    desc2: `Cross-country skiing, a form of skiing where athletes use skis to move across varying terrains, has ancient origins and was developed as a mode of transportation and hunting in snowy regions. It can be considered one of the oldest skiing disciplines. The history of cross-country skiing dates back thousands of years and was initially a practical way for people in snow-covered regions to travel over long distances. It eventually evolved into a competitive sport and recreational activity, with its own set of techniques and equipment, and became part of the Winter Olympics when they were established in the early 20th century. Its invention, therefore, is a gradual process of adaptation from a practical means of transportation to a recreational and competitive sport over many centuries.`,

It involves sliding polished stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area, which is segmented into concentric circles. The objective is to get the stones as close to the center of the target, known as the "house," as possible. Players use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the stone to control its speed and direction. Curling has a rich history and was one of the first sports to be included in the Winter Olympics when it made its debut in 1924.`,

    From 1980 until 1987, BMX Freestyle increased in popularity. The discipline’s founding governing body was first called the Amateur Skate Park Association (ASPA) in 1982, and then a couple years after, it changed to the American Freestyle Association (AFA). Eventually, the discipline became governed by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI).`,

    desc2: `Bicycle motocross (BMX) started in the late 1960s in California, around the time that motocross became a popular sport in the USA. The motorised version of the sport was the inspiration for the human-powered competition.

    BMX racing offered exciting action at a low cost, and the infant sport became an instant hit, especially in California. This led to the foundation of a sanctioning body for BMX in the USA in the early 1970s. Over the following decade, the sport gradually gained in international popularity.
    
    In April 1981, the International BMX Federation was founded. BMX rapidly developed a unique sporting identity and it became evident that the sport had more in common with cycling than motorcycling. This was officially recognised in 1993, when BMX was fully integrated into the International Cycling Union (UCI).`,
    desc3: `The main rules related to the sport are related to safety equipment, bike sizes, age group limits, and how racers advance through events. Competitions are usually held in 'motos', or heats, of up to 8 racers at a time. Heats may be single-elimination, with the top few finishers moving on, or a series of races with points awarded according to finishing position.`,
    desc4: `A total of 48 racers, 24 in each event, will compete at Paris 2024. They will start with four quarter-finals of six racers before moving on to two semi-finals of eight racers and a final of eight racers. Quarter- and semi-final motos will be held as a series of three heats, while the final is a single race.`,

Taking a bike off-road was nothing new, but the development of a new bike that relished such terrain was; these bikes had fatter tyres, rapid-shift gears, drum brakes and ground-breaking suspension. These bikes gave thrill-seeking cyclists much more freedom, and the sport of mountain biking was born.

    The members of the Velo Club Mount Tamalpais in California generally receive the credit for establishing mountain biking as a sport. They invented the Repack Downhill race, held regularly between 1976 and 1979 just across the famous Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. The races attracted riders from near and far, and the media soon started taking an interest.`,
    desc3: `Aside from rules governing electric bikes in e-mtb, competitive mountain biking is straightforward—the first across the finish line wins. Technical assistance provided to competitors may be allowed depending on the event. In some disciplines, being lapped or falling too far behind the leader eliminates a rider from a race.`,
    desc4: `Mountain bike racing, particularly in the cross-country (XC) discipline, takes place on challenging off-road courses, often hilly and technical. Riders must wear helmets and adhere to bike specifications set by the race organization. The race duration and terrain vary, with riders starting in groups organized by categories. Passing etiquette, dismounting in technical sections, and other safety considerations are part of the rules. Penalties may apply for infractions. Environmental stewardship and responsible trail use are also emphasized. The winner is the rider who completes the course in the shortest time, and riders earn points contributing to overall rankings in some cases. Specific rules can vary by race and discipline, so participants should consult event organizers for precise guidelines.`,
    desc5: `The first national mountain bike championships were held in 1983 in the USA. But the sport quickly grew in popularity in Europe and Australia. The first mountain bike World Championships, recognised by the International Cycling Union (UCI), were organised in 1990.

    In 1885, cycling took a big leap forward when J.K. Starley devised the chain-and-gearing system. Since then, engineers have embraced modern technology to build ever faster, sleeker and lighter bikes.
    
    From 1880 to 1900, cycling became immensely popular both in Europe and the United States. The professional sport maintained its place in the public imagination, especially in Europe. Over the last 20 years, road cycling has experienced a movement towards globalisation.`,
    desc3: `Depending on the organiser of each race, there may be different rules specific to each race (such as limits on rider feeds or technical or radio assistance). However, dangerous blocking—especially in sprint finishes—is outlawed at competitive levels and can result in a time penalty, relegation to the back of the field, or disqualification. There are also rules on allowable equipment.`,
    desc4: `In Olympic road cycling, scoring is straightforward and time-based. Competitors race on road courses, and the winner is the rider who crosses the finish line first. Time is the primary factor, with all riders aiming to complete the course in the shortest time possible. There are no subjective scoring criteria involved, making it a test of speed, endurance, and tactics. In some cases, intermediate sprints and points are awarded during the race, contributing to the overall score, but the winner is ultimately determined by the total time taken to finish the event.`,
    desc5: `Like fencing and athletics, cycling is among the rare sports that have always featured on the Olympic programme. Road cycling, however, was not on the programme of the Paris 1900, St. Louis 1904 or London 1908 Games.

    The first road event in Olympic history took place in 1896 on the marathon route at the first Games of the modern era in Athens. The race started in Athens, headed towards Marathon, then returned to Athens, at the Phaliron velodrome.
    
    Since the 1912 Games in Stockholm, an individual event (time trial or road race) has been organised at each edition of the Games. The team time trial was on the programme between 1912 and 1992. 1996 marked the debut of the individual time trial, separate to the road race, at the Olympic Games in Atlanta.
    
    Olympic cycling was added to the women’s programme in Los Angeles in 1984, with an individual road event. Later, in 1996, the individual time trial was included in women’s Olympic cycling, as it was for the men’s.`,

    title2: `cycling track`,
    desc1: `Track cycling involves races on bikes set on an oval track, often made of wood and usually indoors but not always, in a velodrome.`,
    desc2: `Bicycles were first developed in the mid-18th century and have been a popular form of transport ever since.

    As early as 1870, track races in England were regularly attracting large crowds. The riders competed on wooden indoor tracks that closely resembled the modern velodromes of today. Such tracks ensured the event could be competed all year round. But for promoters, there was an even greater benefit—spectators could be charged an entrance fee.`,
    desc3: `The rules differ from event to event within track cycling, but generally the sport involves crossing the finishing line first or obtaining the most points or laps of the field to win.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in track cycling is event-specific. In sprint events, the first to the finish line wins. In endurance events, points are awarded during races or the fastest time wins. Elimination races eliminate riders in stages, and keirin involves sprinting after pacing. In omnium, riders accumulate points across multiple races, and team events are decided by the fastest time. Rules can vary between disciplines, so it's crucial to review the specific event's regulations.`,
    desc5: `Track cycling events have been organised at all the editions of the Games since 1896, with the exception of the 1912 Games in Stockholm, when only the road race was staged. Between 1924 and 1992, the range of events was generally as follows: sprint, time trial over one kilometre, tandem and team pursuit. The individual pursuit was added to the programme of the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, and the tandem was dropped after the 1972 Games in Munich.

    Women have competed in the track events since the Seoul Games in 1988.`,

    title1: `Diving`,
    title2: `diving`,
    desc1: `Diving is a sport where athletes jump or fall into water from a platform or springboard while performing acrobatic routines.

    As such, competitors similar characteristics as gymnasts, including strength, flexibility, balance, power, and air awareness.`,
    desc2: `The sport of diving became popular in Sweden and Germany in the 18th and 19th centuries, and was primarily practised by gymnasts who started performing tumbling routines into the water.

    In the late 19th century, a group of Swedish divers visited Great Britain. They put on diving displays that proved hugely popular and led to the formation of the first diving organisation, the Amateur Diving Association, in 1901.`,
    desc3: `There are two types of diving board at the Olympics: springboard and platform.

    Springboard diving takes place on a flexible board three metres above the water that propels athletes upwards.
    
    Platform boards sit 10 metres above the water and are rigid, meaning that athletes have to generate their own power, or simply drop into their routine.
    
    There are both individual and synchronised (featuring two athletes) events for both springboard and platform diving at the Olympics. Men compete over six rounds, while women compete over five.
    
    Individual dives are scored by a panel of seven World Aquatics-appointed judges, who rate the dive based on the starting position, the take-off, the flight, and the entry into the water. The top two and bottom two scores are eliminated, and the final three scores are added together and multiplied by the degree of difficulty rating of the dive to achieve the total score for that dive.
    
    The highest overall combined score at the end is declared the winner.
    
    It is the same process for synchronised diving, except there are 11 judges: six grading the divers’ execution, and five grading synchronisation.`,
    desc4: `In diving, judges evaluate performances based on specific criteria: the degree of difficulty, execution quality, takeoff, flight, entry into the water, synchronization (in synchronized diving), and overall impression. Divers receive scores, often on a scale from 0 to 10, for each dive. The highest and lowest scores are usually dropped, and the remaining scores are summed, sometimes multiplied by the degree of difficulty, to determine the final score for the dive. The diver with the highest overall score for their dives wins the competition. Scoring can vary somewhat between different diving events and organizations, but these principles are fundamental.`,
    desc5: `Diving was included in the Olympic Games for the first time at the Olympic Games St. Louis 1904. The springboard and platform events have been included since the 1908 Olympic Games in London. Since the Stockholm Games in 1912, women have taken part in the diving events.

    The first Olympic competitions differed from those which exist nowadays, notably with respect to the height of the platforms and springboards. The diving programme has been relatively stable since the 1928 Games in Amsterdam: men and women take part in 10-metre high-dive and 3-metre springboard events. In 2000, the Sydney Games witnessed the entrance of synchronised diving on both the springboard and the platform.
    
    This discipline was first dominated by the USA, with four-time Olympic gold medallist Greg Louganis considered one of the sport’s finest athletes ever. But this domination started to waver with the emergence of the People’s Republic of China at the end of the 1980s. Since then, the Asian powerhouse has dominated the sport of diving across the men’s and women’s disciplines.`,

    title2: `equestrian`,
    desc1: `Equestrian is the broad umbrella term for sport involving riding on horseback. There are numerous equestrian disciplines ranging from horse racing and vaulting (gymnastics on horseback) to polo and rodeo.

    There are three disciplines in the Olympic Games: dressage, eventing, and jumping (also known as show jumping).`,
    desc2: `Evidence of horses being ridden dates back to around 3500BC. Chariot racing was popular in Ancient Greece and one of the highlights of the ancient Olympic Games.

    Of the modern Olympic disciplines, dressage has its roots in Greek historian Xenophon's work 'On Horsemanship' which covers training of horses although competitive dressage has evolved considerably from the original 'classical' form.
    
    Show jumping started when fences were put up in the English countryside, leading fox hunters to require horses that could jump. But it was not until the second half of the 19th century - notably at the 1869 Dublin Horse Show - that it was adapted for spectators with fences erected in an arena for 'horse leaping'.
    
    Eventing was originally developed to test and prepare cavalry horse with its first competition held in 1902.`,
    desc3: `Dressage consists of a number of tests in which horse and rider are awarded marks for performing routines containing specified movements.

    Jumping sees horse and rider try to clear a number of obstacles (fences) following a prescribed route without dislodging them. If two or more pairings achieve clear rounds, a timed jump-off is used to decide the winner.
    
    Eventing was originally developed to test and prepare cavalry horses. It consists of three different disciplines: a dressage test followed by cross-country - a timed 6km-long ride comprising around 30 solid obstacles - and then jumping.
    
    Ahead of all disciplines, horses must pass veterinary inspection in order to compete. In jumping and cross-country, there are penalties (faults) for hitting or missing out or "refusing" (horse not attempting) an obstacle.`,
    desc4: `In equestrian sports like dressage, show jumping, and eventing, scoring criteria differ but share common elements. Dressage evaluates movements, gaits, submission, and the rider's position. Show jumping assesses faultless jumping and, in some cases, time. Eventing combines dressage, cross-country, and show jumping with cumulative penalties for faults. Lower scores or penalties are generally better, and specific rules may vary among organizations and competitions.`,
    desc5: `Equestrian sports first featured at the Paris 1900 Olympic Games with competitions in a number of jumping events and polo taking place.

    They were omitted from the 1904 Games with only polo included in 1908. But Stockholm 1912 saw the first dressage and eventing competitions, as well as jumping, and these have been fixtures ever since.
    
    Polo made sporadic appearances at the Games - five in total - before being dropped after Berlin 1936.
    
    Only men competed in equestrian initially with riders having to be either commissioned military officers or "gentlemen". This restriction was lifted in 1951 and women competed alongside men in dressage at Helsinki 1952. Women were then admitted to jumping in 1956 and eventing in 1964.
    
    There has been little change to the Olympic programme over the years with individual and team medals at stake in all three disciplines since Amsterdam 1928.`,

    title1: `Fencing`,
    title2: `fencing`,
    desc1: `Fencing is a combat sport in which two athletes use swords to attack and defend against one another with the aim of striking their opponent in order to score points.

    The three disciplines of modern fencing are the foil, the épée, and the sabre (also called saber). Each discipline uses a different kind of blade (which shares the same name) and has unique rules.`,
    desc2: `Evidence of sword fights goes back as far as Ancient Egypt in 1190 BC with bouts and duels continuing until the 18th century.

    Fencing was originally a form of military training and started to evolve into a sport in the 14th or 15th century in both Germany and Italy.
    
    German fencing masters organised the first guilds, the most notable being the Marxbrueder of Frankfurt in 1478.
    
    The sport's popularity increased in the 17th and 18th centuries due to the invention of a weapon with a flattened tip known as the foil, a set of rules governing the target area, and a wire-mesh mask.
    
    The first formal fencing competition - the Grand Military Tournament and Assault at Arms - was held in London in 1880; sixteen years later the Amateur Gymnastic and Fencing Association (now British Gymnastics) drew up official regulations for the sport - the same year fencing appeared at the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896.`,
    desc3: `A fencing bout involves two fencers and a referee. The objective is for an athlete to land hits or ‘touches’ with their sword on designated areas of their opponent’s body in order to score points. All three disciplines take place on a piste which is 14m long and 1.5m-2m wide. Retreating off the end of the piste results in a point to the opponent. Each touch is worth one point, and each bout is separated into three periods of three minutes (with a one-minute break between periods). The first competitor to reach 15 points - or the athlete in the lead when the third period is completed - is declared the winner.

    In team competition, each member of one team faces each member of the other team once (for a total of nine bouts). Each bout is three minutes long, or to 5 points, with the score carrying over between bouts. If the ninth bout is completed and neither team has 45 points, the team with the most points is declared the winner.`,
    desc4: `In fencing, scoring involves landing valid hits on your opponent's designated target area, following the rules of the specific discipline (foil, épée, or sabre). Right of way applies in foil and sabre, determining priority for attacks. Electronic scoring systems and judges are used to detect hits, with colored lights indicating the scoring fencer. Penalties can be imposed for rule violations, affecting the score. Fencing scoring varies by discipline, but the common objective is to execute valid actions and earn points while avoiding your opponent's hits.`,
    desc5: `Fencing is just one of five sports which have been permanent fixtures at the Olympic Games since the first modern Games were held in 1896. Only three events were contested at the 1896 Games in Athens (men’s individual foil, men’s individual sabre, masters foil), but that number has since increased to 12, with men’s and women’s individual and team competitions for each discipline.`,

    title2: `figure skating`,
    desc1: `Figure skating, as its name suggests, involves skating "figures" on ice. The sport requires competitors to skate selected patterns, or figures, as part of their routines. Ice skating has developed from a practical way to get around on ice into the elegant mix of art and sport it is today.`,
    desc2: `The Dutch were arguably the earliest pioneers of skating. They began using canals to maintain communication by skating from village to village as far back as the 13th century. Skating eventually spread across the channel to England, and soon the first clubs and artificial rinks began to form. Passionate skaters included several kings of England, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon III and German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

    Two Americans are responsible for the major developments in the history of the sport. In 1850, Edward Bushnell of Philadelphia revolutionised skating when he introduced steel-bladed skates allowing complex manoeuvres and turns. Jackson Haines, a ballet master living in Vienna in the 1860s, added elements of ballet and dance to give the sport its grace.`,
    desc3: `Skaters must perform a set number of jumps in each routine in singles and pairs events and follow a set theme in ice dancing. Falls and other penalties are penalised with points deductions. The total score counts for the overall result.`,
    desc4: `There are two key parts to a figure skating score under the current ISU Judging System: technical elements (TES) and program components (PCS). In simple terms, TES measures the routine's technicality (such as jump difficulty and how well-executed each element—jumps, spins, et cetera—is performed) and PCS measures the routine's performance (such as music and choreography). The two parts combined determines the score for the segment (short program, rhythm dance, free skating, or free dance). A skater's final overall score is made up of the two different segment scores.`,
    desc5: `Figure skating is the oldest sport on the Olympic Winter Games programme. It was contested at the 1908 London Games (in summer) and again in 1920 in Antwerp (also in summer), pre-dating the first Olympic Winter Games. Men’s, women’s and pairs were the three events contested until 1972. Since 1976, ice dancing has been the fourth event in the programme, proving a great success.

    Sonja Henie made her Olympic debut in Chamonix in 1924, aged just 11, and was so nervous she had to ask her coach what to do midway through her routines. However, she won gold in the next three Olympic Games and developed a huge legion of fans. She later moved into films, where she greatly increased the popularity of her sport.
    
    Dick Button and Hanyu Yuzuru are the only men to have won back-to-back Olympic gold medals in the sport.`,

    desc2: `Football has its roots in ancient China while the modern version of the game began on the streets of medieval England. Neighbouring towns would play each other in games where a heaving mass of players would struggle to drag a pig’s bladder by any means possible to markers at either end of town.

    English football's governing body, the Football Association, codified the laws of the game in 1863.`,
    desc3: `Two teams of 11 players each try to place the ball into a goal by using any part of their anatomy with the exception of the hand or arm.

    Players must not be overly physical in their attempts to win the ball, and a mistimed challenge, eg. kicking the opposing player before the ball, will lead to a free-kick to the opposition. This can be a penalty (spot-kick) if the 'foul' occurs in the player's own penalty area.
    
    Each team has a goalkeeper who is permitted to handle the ball only inside their own penalty area. If they are outside the area, they are considered as an outfield player.`,
    desc4: `In football (soccer), scoring is achieved by getting the ball into the opposing team's goal. A goal is awarded when the entire ball crosses the goal line. A standard goal counts as one point, and the team with the most goals at the end of the match wins. If the match ends in a draw, it may result in a tie or be decided by extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the competition's rules.`,
    desc5: `Football made its Olympic debut at Paris 1900 and has appeared at every Games since with the exception of Los Angeles 1932.

    Professional players were first admitted, with some restrictions, at Los Angeles 1984, and Barcelona 1992 saw it become an under-23 tournament.
    
    Four years later at Atlanta, three overage players were permitted per squad and this remains the current situation regarding eligibility.
    
    Atlanta 1996 also saw women's football make its Olympic debut with hosts USA claiming the first title. The USWNT has won four of the seven women's Olympic football competitions.`,

    desc3: `Freestyle skiing combines acrobatics, aerials, and skiing on various terrains. Athletes perform tricks, jumps, and maneuvers in events like moguls, aerials, and slopestyle, aiming for creativity, style, and technical precision, with judges awarding scores based on execution, difficulty, and amplitude while adhering to safety regulations.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in freestyle skiing is based on a combination of factors, including the execution, difficulty, and amplitude of tricks and maneuvers performed by athletes. Judges assess the skier's style, precision, and overall performance, awarding scores on a scale that reflects the quality of the run. Athletes aim to achieve the highest score by showcasing their skills with creativity and flair while ensuring their safety during competitions.`,

    Futsal is a five-a-side format of football, and the only form of indoor football approved by world governing body FIFA. Futsal emphasises technique, creativity, improvisation and ball control.`,
    desc2: `Futsal’s origins can be traced to South America, where Argentine-born coach Juan Carlos Ceriani devised a variation of the traditional 11-a-side football game for indoor competitions in YMCAs in Montevideo, Uruguay. Meanwhile, in São Paulo, Brazil, a game was also developing on the streets. Futsal soon spread through the continent. Participation continues to grow, and FIFA estimates more than 30 million play futsal globally.`,
    desc3: `Futsal is an indoor soccer variant played with two teams of five players each. The game features a smaller court, no walls, and specific rules, including a 20-minute duration for each half, unlimited substitutions, kick-ins instead of throw-ins, goalkeeper restrictions, and accumulated fouls leading to 10-meter penalty kicks. The team that scores the most goals wins, with tied matches possibly resulting in overtime or a penalty shootout.`,
    desc4: `Futsal was first included on the Olympic programme at the Summer Youth Olympic Games Buenos Aires 2018, where it replaced 11-a-side football contested at Singapore 2010 and Nanjing 2014.

    desc1: `Golf is a sport where the idea is to hit a ball with a club from the tee into the hole in as few strokes as possible.`,
    desc2: `Golf is believed to have been practised first in the Netherlands under the name “colf” or “kolven” and arrived in Britain in the 15th century.

    Its first rules were established in the Scottish city of St. Andrews, long known as the home of golf, in 1754`,
    desc3: `The essential rule of golf is, for each stroke, the player to play the ball as it lies, and the course as they find it.

    They start with a tee shot and finish in the hole on a closely mown surface called a green where only the putter is allowed to be used. For longer holes, the player should aim for the fairway (another mown surface) from where they can play an approach shot into the green.
    
    There are numerous hazards including bunkers, also known as sand traps, rough, trees and water hazards. If the ball goes into the water, the player incurs a penalty shot and must drop the ball close to where the ball entered the water or play the shot again.
    
    Each round lasts 18 holes with most professional tournaments comprising four rounds. There is often a cut after two rounds eliminating just over a third of the starters.`,
    desc4: `Each hole has a par score which is the number of shots a high-quality golfer should take to complete it. The shortest holes are par-3s with par-4s and then par-5s which, before recent advances in club technology, often required three shots to land the ball on the green.

    In stroke play golf, the format used in most professional tournaments, a player's score for a round is the aggregate number of strokes taken over the 18 holes. Their tournament score will be the total over the four rounds (72 holes).
    
    Completing a hole in one-under-par, for example three strokes on a par-4, is known as a birdie. An eagle is the name given to a hole completed two strokes under par.
    
    An albatross, sometimes called a double eagle, is a rare bird in that it is a hole completed in three-under-par, ie. a two on a par-5.
    
    A course will have a par score which is usually between 70 and 72 with the majority of holes classified as par-4s.`,
    desc5: `Golf was played at the 1900 Games in Paris with Margaret Ives Abbott winning the women's event and fellow American Charles Edward Sands the men's. Four years later, the women's event was replaced by a team event but golf was dropped after those St. Louis Games.

    In October 2009, IOC members voted in favour of re-introducing golf to the Olympic programme for Rio 2016. Great Britain's Justin Rose won the men's title with Republic of Korea's Inbee Park claiming women's gold.`,

    Between 1938 and 1966, both forms of handball were played at separate World Championships with indoor handball gaining pre-eminence.`,
    desc3: `Modern handball is played on an indoor court measuring 40m x 20m between two teams of seven players each. Players can take up to three steps without bouncing the ball and are allowed to hold onto it for a maximum of three seconds.

    Body contact is permitted in what is a very physically demanding sport. Offensive strategies are encouraged with passive play resulting in a warning followed by the team giving up possession.`,

If the match ends in a tie, it may be decided by extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the competition's rules. The sport combines elements of soccer and basketball and involves high-scoring matches due to the smaller size of the goals and the fast-paced nature of the game.`,

    Indoor handball was played for the first time at the Olympics in Munich 1972 and Yugoslavia's men won the 16-team tournament.
    
    Women's handball was introduced to the Games in 1976 with the Soviet Union claiming women's and men's gold in Montreal.
    
    All medals at previous Games have been won by European teams with the notable exception of the Republic of Korea who took consecutive women's gold at Seoul 1988 and Barcelona 1992 as well as men's silver in Seoul.

    desc2: `Ice hockey originated in Canada in the early 19th century, based on several similar sports played in Europe, although the word “hockey” comes from the old French word “hocquet”, meaning “stick”. Around 1860, a puck was substituted for a ball, and in 1879, two McGill University students, Robertson and Smith, devised the first rules.

    The first recognised team, the McGill University Hockey Club, was formed in 1880 as hockey became the Canadian national sport and spread throughout the country. In 1892, the Governor General of Canada donated the Stanley Cup, which was first won by a team representing the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association.
    
    The sport migrated south to the United States during the 1890s, and games are known to have taken place there between Johns Hopkins and Yale universities in 1895. Ice hockey spread to Europe around the turn of the century, and the first Olympic Games to include ice hockey for men were 1920 Antwerp Games (in summer, predating the first Olympic Winter Games).`,
    desc3: `The basic aim of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team within the allotted time. There are rolling substitutions for each team. Penalties are penalised by removing the offending player(s) from the game to the penalty box for a period of 2 (minor penalty), 4 (double minor penalty), 5 (major penalty), or 10 (misconduct penalty) minutes.`,
    desc4: `In ice hockey, scoring is achieved by successfully shooting the puck into the opposing team's goal. A goal is awarded when the entire puck crosses the goal line. Each goal is worth one point. Ice hockey is typically played with two teams, and the team with the most goals at the end of the game wins. In some leagues or competitions, if the match ends in a tie during regular time, it may go into overtime or a shootout to determine the winner. Scoring in ice hockey requires precision, teamwork, and strategic play to outscore the opposing team.`,
    desc5: `Six-a-side men’s ice hockey has been on the programme of every edition of the Winter Games since 1924 in Chamonix. Women’s ice hockey was accepted as an Olympic sport in 1992, and made its official debut in 1998 in Nagano.

    Unsurprisingly, Canada dominated the first tournaments. However, in 1956, and until its dissolution, the Soviet Union took over and became the number one team. It was interrupted only by USA victories in 1960 in Squaw Valley and in 1980 in Lake Placid.
    
    Professional National Hockey League players competed in men's tournaments from 1998 through 2014.`,

    title2: `judo`,
    desc1: `Judo is a Japanese martial art that focuses on throws and grappling techniques to subdue opponents, with an emphasis on physical fitness, mental discipline, and sportsmanship.`,
    desc2: `Judo was invented by Jigoro Kano in Japan in 1882 as a safe and effective form of physical education and self-defence based on the principles of maximum efficiency and mutual benefit.`,
    desc3: `In judo points are awarded for throws, holds, and submissions. The aim is to throw the opponent to the ground with force or hold them down for a certain amount of time.

    Competitions are divided into weight categories, with the aim of ensuring that opponents are matched in size and strength.`,
    desc4: `In judo, scoring is based on the execution of throws and techniques. The highest score is an ippon, awarded for a perfect throw that results in an immediate win. A waza-ari signifies a successful, but not perfect, throw, while yuko indicates a less dominant technique. Penalties (shido) may be given for rule violations, and in case of a tie, a "golden score" period can determine the winner. Judo scoring emphasizes effective throws and the control and dominance of the opponent.`,
    desc5: `Judo made its very first appearance at the Olympic Games in 1964 in Tokyo. However, it was not included in the Olympic programme in 1968 in Mexico City, but returned, never to leave again, at the 1972 Games in Munich. As for women’s judo, it was added to the Games in 1992 in Barcelona.

    Men and women now compete in seven weight categories. There was originally a men’s category open to all weights, but this event was withdrawn after the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
    
    Japan is the most successful nation at the Olympics with a total of 96 medals (including 48 golds). France and South Korea are next in line, with 57 and 46 medals, respectively. Other nations with a successful Olympic history include Russia, Georgia, Italy and Brazil.`,

    desc1: `Karate is a Japanese martial art that uses striking techniques with hands, feet, elbows, and knees, as well as blocking and grappling, to develop physical and mental discipline.`,
    desc2: `Karate is an ancient discipline with the roots of its current form originating on the Japanese island of Okinawa during the Ryukyu Dynasty, which was established in the 15th century.

    It became popular across Japan in the 1920s and expanded internationally following World War II.
    
    A karate practitioner is called a karateka.`,
    desc3: `Karate has clear rules governing controlled strikes to designated target areas, such as the head and chest, depending on the style. Competitors score points with precise techniques during matches of specified durations. Fouls, illegal moves, and unsportsmanlike conduct result in penalties. Protective gear is worn, and traditional forms (kata) are also evaluated for precision and technique. Rule variations exist among different karate styles and organizations, but the sport emphasizes skill, control, and technique in both sparring and kata.`,
    desc4: `In karate, scoring involves earning points through precise and controlled strikes to designated target areas. Strikes, including punches and kicks, must be executed with accuracy. Competitors accumulate points during matches, with the one having the most points at the end declared the winner. Rules may vary depending on the style and organization, but karate competitions emphasize skill, technique, and control in strikes and maneuvers.`,
    desc5: `Karate made its full Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020 after being on the programme at the Youth Olympic Games Buenos Aires 2018.

    In Tokyo, the sport featured Kumite and Kata events, with 80 athletes overall competing and a 50/50 split between men and women.
    
    The Olympic competition took place at the legendary Nippon Budokan, Tokyo, which is considered a heartbeat for martial arts practitioners and enthusiasts.`,

    desc1: `Luge riders hurtle down a slippery ice track at great speed, relying on reflexes for steering. Unlike bobsleigh, however, they have no protection should they make an error.`,
    desc2: `Luge is the French word for “sledge” and, like bobsleigh, it was developed as a sport in Switzerland. Its roots go back to the 16th century, but it was not until 300 years later that the first luge tracks were built by Swiss hotel owners to cater for thrill-seeking tourists.
    
    The first international race course was held in Davos in 1883, with competitors racing along an icy 4km road between Davos and the village of Klosters.`,
    desc3: `Luge is a winter sport where athletes slide feet-first on a small sled down an ice track. Competitors aim to complete the course in the shortest time possible. Luge races involve four runs, and the combined time determines the winner. Athletes use body movements to control their sleds and follow strict safety regulations. The sport emphasizes speed, precision, and technique while adhering to specific track and equipment guidelines.`,
    desc4: `In luge, scoring is relatively simple and based on time. The aim is to complete the course in the shortest time possible. Luge athletes race down a twisting and turning ice track, and the competitor with the fastest time at the end of the event wins. Unlike some sports with subjective judging, luge's scoring relies solely on objective timing, making it a test of speed, precision, and technique. The athlete with the quickest run down the course secures victory in luge competitions.`,
    desc5: `It was not until 1955 that the first World Championship was organised, 41 years after the first European Championships. Nine years later, in 1964, luge made its Olympic debut at the Innsbruck Games, with a mixed event, a men’s event and a women’s event. The programme has not changed since then. Since 1976, this sport has taken place on the same track as bobsleigh.

    The discipline was dominated by the East Germans, who won 15 of the 21 gold medals available between 1964 and 1988. One of the undisputed masters of luge is a German: Georg Hackl, who won gold three times consecutively, in 1992 in Albertville, 1994 in Lillehammer and 1998 in Nagano.`,

    title1: `Marathon Swimming`,
    title2: `marathon swimming`,
    desc1: `Marathon swimming sees athletes take on a 10km course in open water environments such as the sea, rivers and lakes - meaning it is as much a test of mental strength and tactical ability, as it is physical endurance.

    The open environment means that athletes must adjust to changing currents, while physical contact between competitors and water stops are a regular occurance.
    
    After approximately two hours of racing there is an exciting sprint finish in the final three kilometres.`,
    desc2: `The concept of marathon swimming has been around since Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim across the English Channel in 1875. Another notable marathon swim took place in 1926, when 19-year-old Gertrude Ederlee became the first woman to make the crossing between England and France.

    “Open water” swimming became an official World Aquatics (then called FINA) discipline at the 1991 World Championships 1991 in Perth, Australia, where both men and women competed on a 25km course. The 10km distance was added in 2001 in Fukuoka, Japan.`,
    desc3: `Marathon swimming events must be held in a natural body of water.

    The race features a mass start, where competitors dive in from a platform simultaneously at the sound of a tone with no lane restrictions. As such, incidental contact between swimmers is permitted.
    
    Athletes wear a wristband known as a transponder, which keeps track of their timing in the results system.
    
    Athletes must touch a pad at the end of the race to stop the clock, and can be disqualified for pacing, slipstreaming, walking or jumping, or finishing without their transponder.`,
    desc4: `Marathon swimming, often referred to as open water swimming, doesn't typically have a traditional scoring system like other sports. In marathon swimming events, participants race over long distances in open water, and the objective is to complete the designated course in the fastest time. The winner is the swimmer who reaches the finish line first. Some events may use electronic timing systems to record exact times, but scoring is primarily based on the order of finish. Safety and adherence to specific rules, including buoy turns and feedings, are crucial in these endurance races.`,
    desc5: `Before the adoption of swimming pools, swimming events took place in open water environments like oceans, rivers and lakes at the first three editions of the modern Olympic Games.

    However, the first official Marathon swimming event for men and women took place with a 10km race at the Olympic Games Beijing 2008.
    
    The Netherlands have been the most successful nation so far with three Olympic gold medallists in Maarten van der Weijden (2008), Sharon van Rouwendaal (2016), and Ferry Weertman (2016).
    
    Tunisia’s Oussama Mellouli, who won men’s 1500m freestyle Olympic gold at Beijing 2008, became the first athlete in history to win swimming and marathon swimming medals at the same Olympics when he won the 10km marathon event and took bronze in the 1500m freestyle at London 2012.`,

    desc1: `Modern Pentathlon comprises five different disciplines: swimming, fencing, horse riding (show jumping), pistol shooting and running.

    The last two have been combined in recent Olympic Games what is known as the laser run.`,
    desc2: `The original pentathlon - consisting of running, jumping, spear-throwing, discus and wrestling - was the climax of the Games in Ancient Greece. It held a position of unique importance with the winner ranked as 'Victor Ludorum'.

    The modern version was introduced by Pierre de Coubertin at the Stockholm Games in 1912. It was his belief that this event would test “a man’s moral qualities as much as his physical resources and skills, producing thereby a complete athlete”.`,
    desc3: `Athletes score points through their performances in the first three events - swimming, fencing and show jumping.

    Those points are converted to starting times for the closing laser run - a 3.2km cross-country test including four rounds of laser pistol shooting.
    
    Having originally been held over five days, with one event per day, the Olympic modern pentathlon now takes just two with the first day comprising the ranking round of fencing where each competitor faces another in round-robin once.
    
    The second day starts with the 200m freestyle swim followed by the fencing bonus round in which athletes are eliminated once defeated.
    
    Next up is show jumping where the athletes are paired with unfamiliar horses before taking a course of 12 obstacles.
    
    The climax is the laser run where the first athlete across the line takes gold.`,
    desc4: `Modern pentathlon combines five distinct disciplines: fencing, swimming, equestrian show jumping, and a combined event of laser pistol shooting and cross-country running. The scoring in modern pentathlon is a complex, points-based system designed to balance the competition and provide equal opportunities for all athletes. Athletes earn points in the individual events, and their scores are then converted into time advantages or delays for the combined event. The competitor with the highest points going into the combined event starts first, and the others follow based on their point deficits or advantages. The first athlete to cross the finish line in the combined event wins the competition. The exact point allocation and conversion formula can vary, but the aim is to ensure a fair competition where the best overall athlete prevails.`,
    desc5: `Modern pentathlon made its first Olympic appearance as an individual event at Stockholm 1912 with a team event added at Helsinki 1952.

    There were major changes for Atlanta 1996 with the team event dropped and the entire event taking place on one day instead of five.
    
    Sydney 2000 hosted the first Olympic women's modern pentathlon competition.
    
    At London 2012, the shooting and running disciplines were combined with laser guns used instead of lead-firing pistols for the first time for both safety reasons and reduced environmental impact.
    
    And at Rio 2016, the fencing ranking round was introduced with a bonus round taking place alongside the other four disciplines on the second day.`,

    desc1: `This sport, which has a long Olympic history, combines ski jumping and cross-country skiing.`,
    desc2: `For centuries in the snow-covered North, skis were required to chase game and gather firewood in winter time. With long distances between the small, isolated communities, and hard, snowy winters, skiing also became important as means of keeping in social contact. The word “ski” is a Norwegian word which comes from the Old Norse word “skid”, a split length of wood.`,
    desc3: `Nordic Combined is a Winter Olympic sport that combines ski jumping and cross-country skiing. In individual events, athletes first compete in ski jumping, with points earned for jump distance and style. These points are then converted into a time handicap for a subsequent cross-country skiing race, where the goal is to finish first. Team events follow a similar format, and the team with the shortest cumulative time in the cross-country skiing race wins. Nordic Combined requires versatility and endurance, making it a demanding and exciting winter sport.`,
    desc4: `In Nordic Combined, scoring combines ski jumping and cross-country skiing. Athletes earn points in the ski jumping portion based on distance and style, and these points determine starting time handicaps for the subsequent cross-country race. The athlete or team finishing first in the cross-country skiing race is declared the winner. This scoring system emphasizes the balance between the two disciplines, making Nordic Combined a unique and challenging winter sport.`,

    desc1: `Olympic rhythmic gymnastics is a female-only event that uses apparatus to showcase skill, flexibility and musicality, and made its Olympic debut in Los Angeles for the 1984 Games. There are just two categories: individual all-around women and group all-around women. Find out everything you need to know about the sport in this video guide to rhythmic gymnastics.`,
    desc2: `Rhythmic gymnastics originated in Europe during the 19th century and has since evolved into an Olympic sport.

    The credit for inventing rhythmic gymnastics goes to the Swedish educator Per Henrik Ling, who developed a system of exercises. Ling's system focused on the harmonious combination of physical movement and music, which laid the foundation for the development of rhythmic gymnastics.
    
    However, it was the Hungarian dancer and gymnast, Emile Jacques-Dalcroze, who first incorporated dance and music into the practice of gymnastics in the early 20th century. Jacques-Dalcroze's approach, known as eurhythmics, used music as a way of expressing and enhancing movement.`,
    desc3: `As with artistic gymnastics, performances in rhythmic gymnastics are given by judges, who assess the performance and award a difficulty (D) score and an execution (E) score, which are combined to give the final score for the routine. The Code of Points is renewed after each Olympics.

    The D score is based on each element of the performance including leaps, jumps and use of apparatus. This difficulty score is unlimited.
    The E score is based on how well the routine was executed either by the individual or the group. This has a starting value of 10 points. The final number is an average of the middle three scores awarded by the judges.
    The D and E scores are combined at this stage, giving a final score. Then, any deductions for penalties are taken away. The list of instant deductions is incredibly long and complex in rhythmic gymnastics. Competitors can be penalised for anything from breaking the apparatus, to the time taken, to landing heavily on their feet.`,
    desc4: `Rhythmic gymnastics is a sport where athletes perform routines with apparatuses like hoops, ribbons, and balls, aiming to showcase their flexibility, balance, and artistic expression. Scoring is based on two primary components: the execution of elements and the artistic impression. Judges assess the accuracy, technique, and difficulty of the performed elements, and they also evaluate the athlete's artistry, expression, and musicality. Deductions are made for imperfections, and scores are awarded on a scale. The athlete with the highest score wins, emphasizing a combination of technical skill and artistic performance.`,
    desc5: `Rhythmic gymnastics competition began in the 1940s in the Soviet Union and was recognised by the International Gymnastics Federation in 1961. Although the first world championships for the sport were held in 1964, rhythmic gymnastics did not make its Olympic debut until 1984 when Canadian Lori Fung took the first Olympic title in the discipline. Group rhythmic gymnastics made its debut at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta where Spain was the champion.`,

    desc1: `Roller speed skating is a fast-paced discipline, with some athletes reaching speeds of up to 50km per hour. Roller speed skating events are usually held on outdoor — and occasionally indoor — rinks with banked walls or on closed road circuits. A maximum of five wheels are allowed on the inline skates athletes wear, and wheels cannot exceed diameters of 110mm. For marathons only, skates can have 125mm diameter wheels. No brakes are allowed. The constant jostling for a favourable position combined with the mass start, velodrome-like walls and 200m track make for thrilling competitions often decided by photo finishes.`,
    desc2: `Roller speed skating, with its roots dating back to the 18th century, has evolved from a simple invention into a competitive sport. It transitioned from quad skates to the introduction of inline skates, growing in popularity through roller rinks and international competitions. Today, roller speed skating encompasses various disciplines and remains a vibrant and competitive sport, with aspirations for Olympic inclusion.`,
    desc3: `Roller Speed Skating encompasses several disciplines, and while rules can vary, they generally require athletes to wear safety gear, follow specified starts and lap counts, avoid obstruction and aggressive contact, and adhere to discipline-specific regulations for track, road, or indoor races. Races involve timed events and may include drafting behind competitors in some cases. Officials ensure rule compliance, with the primary goal being fair and safe competition.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in Roller Speed Skating is primarily based on finishing times, with the fastest skater or team winning the race. In certain events, the number of laps completed or distances covered is also considered. Unlike sports with subjective scoring, Roller Speed Skating relies on objective timing to determine the winner, emphasizing speed, precision, and endurance.`,
    desc5: `Roller speed skating first appeared on the Olympic stage as a demonstration sport at the Summer Youth Olympic Games Nanjing 2014. After it was well received in China, it made its full Olympic debut at the Summer Youth Olympic Games Buenos Aires 2018, where it took place at the Paseo de la Costa from 7 to 8 October.

    For Buenos Aires 2018, each National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter a maximum of two competitors, one per each gender. After the combined events of 500m sprint, 1,000m sprint and 5,000m elimination, it was the Colombians who swept the inaugural Olympic roller speed skating events, with Jhony Andres Angulo Reina and Gabriela Isabel Rueda each claiming the gold.`,

    desc1: `Rowing involves propelling a boat using oars fixed to the vessel. It differs from other disciplines in that rowers sit with their backs to the direction of movement, therefore crossing the finish line backwards.

    In the Olympics, rowers race against each other as individuals or in crews of two, four or eight.`,
    desc2: `Rowing was first used as a means of transport in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. As a sport, it probably began in England in the 17th and early 18th centuries, with the Oxford-Cambridge university boat race in the United Kingdom, which was inaugurated in 1828.

    By the 19th century, rowing was popular in Europe and had been exported to America.`,
    desc3: `Rowers compete across a distance of 2,000 metres, alone or in teams of 2, 4 or 8.

    Double sculls athletes hold one oar in each hand while sweep rowing athletes hold a single oar with both hands.
    
    Eight-person crews have a coxswain, who steers the boat and directs the crew. The boat is steered using a small rudder that is attached to the foot of one of the rowers by a cable.
    
    Lanes are clearly marked by buoys every 10 to 12.5 metres, and the course must have a depth of at least three metres.
    
    Crews committing a false start are first given a warning, and two false starts in the same race leads to a disqualification for that individual or team.
    
    A boat’s final time is determined by when its bow crosses the finish line. In the case of a close finish, a photo finish will be consulted to determine the order that the bow of each boat crossed the line.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in rowing is relatively straightforward and is determined by the order in which boats cross the finish line. In rowing competitions, boats are often classified by the number of rowers and the type of race (e.g., singles, pairs, fours, eights). The first boat to complete the prescribed course is declared the winner. Some events may involve multiple rounds or heats, with the fastest boats advancing to subsequent rounds or finals. Unlike sports with subjective scoring, rowing relies on objective timing and the position of the boats to determine the winner, emphasizing speed and teamwork.`,
    desc5: `Rowing has been staged at every edition of the Olympic Games, except in 1896 in Athens. It was on the programme for those Games, but a stormy sea compelled the organisers to cancel the events.

    Women made their debut at Montreal 1976, while and the Olympic Games Atlanta 1996 marked the introduction of lightweight events.
    
    The USA initially dominated Olympic rowing, before the Soviet Union and Germany came to the forefront. However, Great Britain's Sir Steve Redgrave is considered by many to be the greatest rower of all time, winning gold medals at five Olympic Games, and six world titles.
    
    His female counterpart on the gold medal count is Elisabeta Lipa of Romania, who also won five Olympic gold medals between 1984 and 2004.`,

    desc2: `Legend has it that rugby union was invented during a football match in 1823 when a student at Rugby School in Great Britain called William Webb Elis picked up the ball in his hands and ran over the goal line.

    Between 1845 and 1848, pupils from the Rugby School and students from the University of Cambridge in Great Britain documented and codified the rules of 15-a-side rugby union, while rugby sevens was conceived in 1883 by two butchers, Ned Haig and David Sanderson, as a fund-raising event in Melrose, Scotland.`,
    desc3: `Rugby sevens is played on the same full-sized pitch as 15s, but the team is composed of seven players: three forwards and four backs.

    Any player awarded a yellow card must leave the pitch for two minutes while a red card means they will play no further part in the game.
    
    The ball cannot be passed forward from hand and kicking is permitted.
    
    The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins. Five points are awarded for a try, two for a conversion, three for a penalty, and three for a drop goal.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in rugby involves several methods, with the primary one being the try, worth five points in rugby union and four points in rugby league, achieved by grounding the ball over the opponent's try line. Conversions, penalty goals, and drop goals offer additional points in rugby union, while rugby league includes conversions, penalty goals, and field goals to supplement the scoring. The specific point values and rules may vary depending on the code and level of play.`,
    desc5: `Rugby union has featured at the Olympics four times in its 15-a-side format: at Paris 1900, London 1908, Antwerp 1920, and Paris 1924.

    At the 121st Session in Copenhagen in October 2009, the IOC members voted in favour of re-introducing rugby to the Olympic programme at Rio 2016 in its sevens format. Australia won the women’s title and Fiji’s men won the Pacific island nation’s first ever Olympic gold.

    desc2: `Sailing has for thousands of years been a form of transport used in activities from exploration to fishing and even warfare.

    International yacht racing began in 1851, when a syndicate of members of the New York Yacht Club built a 101-foot schooner named "America". The yacht was sailed to England, where it won a trophy called the Hundred Guineas Cup in a race around the Isle of Wight. The trophy was renamed "The America's Cup" and it remains yachting's most coveted prize as well as the world's oldest international sporting competition.
    
    Racing has spread to other crafts which have continually evolved to reflect advances in boat design and technology. Recent advances have created a trend towards smaller and lighter craft, placing ever greater demands on both the athletic and technical capacities of the sailors.`,
    desc3: `The sport is organised under a single set of rules for racing published by World Sailing. Olympic racing is now conducted with boats categorised into one-design classes based on similar weights and measurements.

    While the America's Cup follows a match race format - one boat against another - most events are fleet races where numerous crafts compete for finishing position.
    
    In fleet races, and match races, crews must do their best to avoid contact and yield to a boat with the right of way.`,
    desc4: `Sailing scoring employs a low-point system where the boat or team with the fewest points across a series of races wins. Each race contributes to the overall score, with consistency being a key factor. Tiebreakers and discards are used to address ties and mitigate the impact of poor performances, making sailing a sport that values both skill and strategic racing.`,
    desc5: `Sailing was first contested as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games after poor weather forced the cancellation of scheduled races at the inaugural Athens 1896 Games. It has appeared at every Games since with the exception of 1904.

    Women competed alongside men in 1900 with the first women's only event introduced at Seoul 1988.
    
    There have been numerous changes to the crafts used over the years with kiteboarding making its debut at Paris 2024.

    desc3: `Shooting is broadly split, for Olympic competition at least, into three different groups: rifle, pistol and shotgun.

    Rifle and pistol competitions are held on shooting ranges where the athletes aim at targets a set distance away. In shotgun events, competitors shoot at clay targets propelled at a series of different directions and angles.
    
    Most events involve a ranking or qualification round in a set time before shooters go up against each other in elimination competition.`,
    desc4: `In shooting sports, scoring is determined by the accuracy of a competitor's shots. A higher score is achieved by hitting the center or "bullseye" of the target, with points often decreasing in value as shots move further from the center. The total score is calculated by adding up the points earned from all shots. In some shooting disciplines, bonus points or tiebreakers may apply. The competitor with the highest total score, or the most points in specific rounds, wins the competition, making precision and consistency critical for success in shooting sports.`,
    desc5: `Shooting has been a near-permanent fixture at the modern Olympic Games, only being omitted at the 1904 and 1928 Games.

    From five events at the inaugural 1896 Games to 15 across six disciplines today, the sport has grown steadily alongside advances in firearms technology.
    
    The current six disciplines consist of four with stationary targets: air pistol, air rifle, 25m pistol (rapid fire for men) and rifle three positions (kneeling, prone, standing).
    
    The other two involving moving clays are trap (where the clay moves away from the shooter), and skeet (where the clay, or sometimes two clays, moves across the shooter).`,

    title2: `short track speed skating`,
    desc1: `In short track speed skating, athletes compete not against the clock, but against each other. This introduces the elements of strategy, bravery and skill needed for racing.`,
    desc2: `Short track (or indoor) speed skating began in Canada and the United States of America, where they held mass-start competitions on an oval track as early as 1905-1906. The lack of 400m long tracks led many North American skaters to practice on ice rinks. However, practicing on a smaller track brought new challenges, like tighter turns and shorter straightaways, which lead to different techniques in order to win on a shorter track. These countries began competing against each other on an annual basis. The sport’s rise in popularity was partly thanks to the North American racing rules, which introduced a “pack” style of racing. Capitalising on this, the organisers of the 1932 Lake Placid Games, with the consent of the International Skating Union (ISU), agreed to follow these rules for the programme’s speed skating events.`,
    desc3: `Short Track Speed Skating is a fast-paced winter sport where athletes race around an oval ice track. Rules include the use of specialized short blades, passing competitors by overtaking them on the inside, and adhering to strict safety regulations. Races are conducted in various distances, with multiple skaters on the ice, and disqualifications can occur for rule violations. Short Track emphasizes speed, strategy, and control while navigating tight turns and close competition.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in Short Track Speed Skating is primarily based on the order in which athletes cross the finish line. In individual races, the first skater to finish is the winner. Relay events involve teams, and the first team to complete the specified distance wins. While no traditional point-based scoring system exists, disqualifications can occur for rule violations, impacting a skater's or team's standings. The focus is on achieving the highest place in the race rather than accumulating points, making speed and tactical maneuvering crucial in Short Track Speed Skating.`,
    desc5: `After having been a demonstration sport at the 1988 Games in Calgary, short track speed skating became part of the Olympic programme in Albertville in 1992, with two individual events and two relays. The discipline comprises men’s and women’s events. Since the 2006 Olympic Games in Turin, the programme of this discipline has included eight events.

    It quickly became popular with the public, who are thrilled to watch rapid races on tight tracks. The skaters race so closely to each other that collisions and falls are inevitable, which is why the walls of the speed skating oval are padded.`,

    title2: `skateboarding`,
    desc1: `Skateboarding is a sport and recreational activity that entails riding and performing tricks on a skateboard.

    Riders stand on a flat wooden board, comprised of a deck, truck and wheels, and a combination of momentum and footwork to execute tricks.`,
    desc2: `Skateboarding first originated in 1950s California in the United States when surfers, looking for something to do when the waves were flat, attached roller skates to their boards.

    No one person is credited with the invention of skateboarding, but the creation of the modern-day skateboard is attributed to former beach lifeguard Larry Stevenson. In 1963 Stevenson founded a skateboard company, Makaha, which revolutionised the rudimentary design of the board.
    
    He created the short surfboard-like design and then later added a kicktail – upward curve – to the back of the board to help the invention of tricks.
    
    A kicktail was later added to the front end of the board.`,
    desc3: `While the requirements of each skateboarding discipline are slightly different the premise of the contests is largely the same, athletes must execute their most impressive tricks, meeting several criteria including difficulty, speed, execution and style.

    The park competition takes place on a course that resembles a bowl within which there will be several different obstacles so that athletes can gather speed and momentum to perform tricks in the air.
    
    The competition for park consists of a preliminary round and a final round. In the preliminary round skaters get three 45-second runs and the best of the three will be used to judge who makes it through to the final round.
    
    Like the preliminary round, skaters will once more have three 45-second timed runs with the best run score counting.
    
    In the event of a tie, the second-highest run decides the tiebreak.
    
    The street competition involves skaters performing tricks on a course that has features that resemble an urban environment including stairs, rails and gaps.
    
    Like the park contest, there is a preliminary round and a final round.
    
    Street skaters begin by performing two 45-second runs and the best score will be carried over to the overall result.
    
    Then there is the best trick section where skateboarders get five attempts to perform their best tricks. The top two scores are then combined with the best run score to form a total score.`,
    desc4: `Skateboarding competitions are scored based on a panel of judges who evaluate each skater's performance in various categories, including difficulty, style, execution, and amplitude. Scores are typically given on a scale, and the highest and lowest scores are often discarded. The remaining scores are averaged to determine a skater's final score. In street events, skaters perform tricks on obstacles like rails and stairs, while in park events, they navigate a bowl or ramp course, showcasing aerial and technical maneuvers. The skater with the highest total score wins the competition, emphasizing a combination of creativity, skill, and consistency.`,
    desc5: `After making its debut on the Olympic stage at the Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games, skateboarding, was one of the five sports to make an Olympic debut at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

    It featured the disciplines of street and park and had separate competitions for men and women.`,

    desc1: `Skeleton racing involves plummeting head-first down a steep and treacherous ice track on a tiny sled. It is considered the world's first sliding sport.`,
    desc2: `Sleighing is one of the oldest winter sports. Descriptions of the sport can be found in 16th-century literature, but as a racing sport, it can be traced to the mid-19th century, when British tourists started sliding down snowbound roads in the Alps. British and American holidaymakers built the first toboggan run in Davos in 1882.
    
    Skeleton sled racing owes it entire early history to St. Moritz and the famed Cresta Run. The sport developed in the Swiss resort town as a pursuit for the rich. E. F. Benson put it best when he wrote in 1913, “There is one Mecca, there is one St. Peter's, and there is one Cresta.”`,

    desc4: `Scoring in skeleton racing is based on cumulative time across multiple runs. Each athlete's time is recorded for every run, and the competitor with the lowest total time at the end of the event is declared the winner. The emphasis is on achieving the fastest descent times with precise navigation of the icy track, making speed and control essential in determining the victor in this high-speed winter sport.`,
    desc5: `Men’s skeleton made two early appearances on the Olympic programme at its “ancestral” home of St. Moritz in 1928 and 1948. It was then dropped until it reappeared as a men’s and women’s event at Salt Lake City in 2002.`,

    title1: `Ski Jumping`,
    title2: `ski jumping`,
    desc1: `Over the past hundred years, ski jumping has evolved enormously, with different jumping techniques allowing jumpers to achieve even greater distances.`,
    desc2: `The origin of ski jumping can be traced to Ole Rye, who jumped 9.5m in 1808. Norwegian Sondre Norheim is widely considered the father of modern ski jumping. In 1866, he won what has been described as the world’s first ski jumping competition with prizes, held at Ofte, Høydalsmo, Norway.
    
    After World War I, Thulin Thams and Sigmund Ruud developed a new jumping style known as the Kongsberger Technique. This involved jumping with the upper body bent at the hips, a wide forward lean, and with arms extended at the front with the skis parallel to each other. Using this technique, Sepp Bradl of Austria became the first to jump more than 100 metres when he jumped 101 metres in 1936.
    
    In the mid-1950s, Swiss jumper Andreas Daescher became the first jumper to hold the arms backwards close to the body with a more extreme forward lean. Then in 1985, Swedish jumper Jan Bokloev started spreading the tips of his skis into a “V” shape. Initially ridiculed, this technique proved so successful that by 1992, all Olympic medallists were using this style.`,
    desc3: `Ski jumping is a Winter Olympic sport where athletes descend a ramp and take off into the air, aiming to achieve the longest jump possible. The rules mandate specific jump styles and equipment, including ski length and bindings. Judges assess factors like distance, style, in-run, and landing. Points are awarded based on jump distance and style, with compensation for wind conditions. Athletes get two jumps in individual events, and the winner is determined by the highest total points across both jumps. Ski jumping combines technical precision, physical prowess, and aerial finesse in a thrilling competition.`,
    desc4: `Scoring in ski jumping is determined by a combination of factors, primarily jump distance and style. Points are awarded based on how far a skier jumps and the quality of their technique in the air and during landing. Judges evaluate factors like body position, balance, and landing stability. Points are added for longer jumps and style, while deductions are made for poor form. Wind and gate compensation factors may also apply. In individual events, skiers typically have two jumps, and the competitor with the highest total points from these jumps wins the competition. Ski jumping requires a blend of precision, technique, and courage in achieving both distance and style.`,
    desc5: `Ski jumping has been part of the Olympic Winter Games since the first Games in Chamonix Mont-Blanc in 1924. The normal hill competition was included on the Olympic programme for the 1964 Innsbruck Games. From 1988, the team event was added as a third competition.`,

    title2: `ski mountaineering`,
    desc1: `In ski mountaineering, often referred to as “skimo”, competitors ski uphill and downhill and use mountaineering abilities to race through snow-covered mountains.`,
    desc2: `Skiing can be traced to prehistoric times, due to man’s necessity to move over hilly and mountainous terrain in an effective way during the snowy winter months. Archaeologists have discovered images that depict figures moving across snow on what appear to be wooden skis, and paintings from the Middle Ages indicate the use of “skins” for snow covered ascents. Furthermore, wooden planks of varying sizes and shapes have been discovered preserved in peat bogs in Russia, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Ski mountaineering originated in Europe, with German Wilhelm Paulcke’s 1897 completion of the first alpine traverse — crossing the Bernese Oberland on skis — considered to be the start of modern ski mountaineering. Originally, there were animal skins, which at the beginning of the twentieth century became only seal skins and nowadays are synthetic.
    
    The discipline is growing in popularity across the world in recent years, counting international events taking place in many countries, such as Switzerland, France, Italy, North America, South America, Russia, Scandinavia, China, South Korea and Japan. The first World Championships for ski mountaineering were held in 2002 in France and now this kind of international event is organised every two years alternatively with the Continental Championships. Furthermore, a World Cup circuit is set up every year with a minimum of five stages. Starting from the 2020-2021 season, and for the years to come, a World Championship Long Distance and a Masters World Championship will be organised. There are currently 38 member national federations of the International Ski Mountaineering Federation (ISMF) belonging to three different continents (Europe, Asia and America).The ski mountaineering discipline attracts athletes from a range of backgrounds, including cyclists, swimmers, runners, hikers and mountaineers.`,
    desc3: `Ski mountaineering, a blend of skiing and mountaineering in alpine terrain, demands a foundation in both skills and a commitment to safety. Prioritize education and training, terrain knowledge, and avalanche safety. Stay vigilant about weather conditions, maintain group dynamics and communication, ensure well-maintained equipment and appropriate clothing, plan routes carefully, and have an emergency kit on hand. Respect the environment and other skiers by practicing Leave No Trace principles, and be aware of local regulations and property rights. Lastly, always prioritize safety and personal limits in this adventurous pursuit.`,
    desc4: `Ski mountaineering, a competitive sport in which athletes race through challenging alpine terrain on skis, typically involves a scoring system that combines timed ascents and descents. Competitors must navigate a series of checkpoints and climbs, transitioning between skiing uphill and downhill. The scoring is often based on the total time taken to complete the course, with time bonuses awarded for reaching certain checkpoints or summits. The athlete with the lowest combined time is the winner. This unique combination of endurance, skiing skill, and mountaineering strategy makes ski mountaineering an exciting and physically demanding sport.`,
    desc5: `The International Ski Mountaineering Federation was recognised as a provisional Olympic Federation in 2014 and then as an official Federation in August 2016. Afterwards, in July 2017, the IOC announced ski mountaineering would join the Youth Olympic Games programme for the Winter Youth Olympic Games Lausanne 2020. At the discipline’s debut, 48 athletes coming from 16 different countries competed across three specialties: Individual race, Sprint race and Mixed Relay race. The first one began with a mass start and showcased athletes’ endurance through three gruelling ascents and as many descents. In the three-to-four-minute Sprint competition, skiers ascended and descended about 80 metres. From the top, they glided down a giant slalom-like course, then raced to the finish in a skating style. The Mixed Relay specialty combined nationalities and genders to feature 11 teams of four athletes (two women and two men).`

    desc2: `Snowboarding was developed in the United States in the 1960s as people across the country began to seek out new winter activities. Over the next decade, various pioneers boosted the production of boards, and the sport began to gain crossover appeal. Surfers and skateboarders became involved, and by 1980, snowboarding was a nationwide activity.`,
    desc3: `Snowboarding, an exhilarating winter sport, is governed by several key rules: always prioritize safety by wearing appropriate protective gear, including a helmet, and obeying trail signs and markers; be aware of your surroundings and other riders, practicing good mountain etiquette; start with a suitable terrain for your skill level and progressively challenge yourself; yield to downhill riders, use proper equipment, and maintain it in good condition; respect the environment by disposing of trash responsibly and adhering to Leave No Trace principles; and finally, continue learning and improving your skills while having fun on the slopes.`,
    desc4: `Snowboarding competitions involve a scoring system that evaluates a rider's performance based on a combination of factors, including tricks, style, and overall execution. Judges assess criteria such as amplitude, difficulty, creativity, and control in the execution of tricks and maneuvers. Scores are typically on a scale, with the highest and lowest scores often dropped, aiming to fairly evaluate the rider's performance throughout a run or a series of runs. The rider with the highest overall score is declared the winner, emphasizing a balance between technical skills and artistic expression in this dynamic and visually impressive sport.`,
    desc5: `Men’s and women’s snowboarding made their Olympic debuts at the Nagano Games in 1998 with giant slalom and halfpipe competitions. The discipline proved an instant success and returned to Salt Lake City four years later with parallel giant slalom and halfpipe competitions. In Turin, snowboard cross also made its debut. In this event, four riders race across a course studded with jumps, bumps and huge turns. Slopestyle was added for 2014 and Big Air for 2018.`

    desc1: `Speed skating began as a rapid form of transportation across frozen lakes and rivers.`,
    desc2: `The Dutch were arguably the earliest pioneers of skating. They began using canals to maintain communication by skating from village to village as far back as the 13th century. Skating eventually spread across the channel to England, and soon the first clubs and artificial rinks began to form. Passionate skaters included several kings of England, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon III and German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.`,
    desc3: `Speed skating is a high-speed, competitive ice sport with the following key rules: athletes race counterclockwise on an oval ice track, with inside lanes having shorter distances; skaters must maintain a low, crouched position to minimize air resistance, and use long, powerful strides to maximize speed; overtaking is allowed by passing on the outside, and skaters must yield if overtaken; false starts may result in disqualification; and contact between skaters, interfering with opponents, or obstructing the racing line is prohibited, all while adhering to specific distance and lane requirements depending on the race type, whether it's short track or long track speed skating.`,
    desc4: `In speed skating, scoring is straightforward and typically based on time. Competitors aim to complete a set distance (such as 500 meters, 1,000 meters, or more) as quickly as possible. The athlete with the fastest time for that distance is declared the winner. In some cases, skaters may compete in multiple races, and their cumulative times may determine the overall winner in a competition. Timing is precise, often measured to the thousandth of a second, emphasizing the paramount importance of speed and precision in this sport.`,
    desc5: `Speed skating appeared for the first time in 1924 at the first Olympic Winter Games in Chamonix. Initially, only men were allowed to participate. It was only at the Lake Placid Games in 1932 that women were authorised to compete in speed skating, which was then only a demonstration sport. It was not until the 1960 Games in Squaw Valley that women’s speed skating was officially included in the Olympic programme.

    The events almost always follow the European system, which consists of skaters competing two-by-two. At the 1932 Olympic Games, the Americans organised American-style events with a mass start. This decision brought about a boycott by many European competitors, which allowed the Americans to win the four gold medals. This system would give birth to short-track speed skating, which was added to the Olympic programme in Albertville in 1992.`

    title2: `sport climbing`,
    desc1: `Sport Climbing is a modern discipline originated from traditional rock climbing. There are three different disciplines: boulder, lead and speed. In all of them, permanent anchors fixed to an artificial wall are used for climbing.`,
    desc2: `It’s believed that climbing in natural rocks as a recreational activity started at the end of the 19th century. Climbing as a competitive sport started in 1985 in Bardonecchia near Turin, Italy in an event called “SportRoccia”. One year later, the first competition event on an artificial climbing wall was organised in Vaulx-en-Velin near Lyon, France.

    In the early 1990s, it was decreed that international events would take place on purposely designed infrastructures only, leaving the natural environment without impact. One of the sport’s core values is the preservation of the environment, with climbers bearing responsibility for the upkeep of the settings in which they climb.
    
    A new era of modern sport climbing started and the first World Championships was organised in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1991.
    
    It has become highly popular over the past two decades. The development of climbing walls has contributed to sport climbing’s popularity, making it accessible to all.`,
    desc3: `There are different rules for each discipline of sport climbing:

    In bouldering, athletes climb 4.5 m high walls without ropes, in a limited period of time and in the fewest attempts possible. The ranking is decided by the number of problems overcome.
    
    In the lead event, athletes climb with a rope as high as they can on a wall over 15m high in six minutes without having seen the route ahead of time. It requires all of the athletes’ physical and mental abilities.
    
    Speed is a spectacular race against the clock in one-on-one elimination rounds that combine precision and explosivity. The wall is 15m high and with an inclination of five degrees. The World Record for men is 5.00 seconds for men (Kiromal Katibin, Indonesia) and 6.53 for women (Aleksandra Miroslaw, Poland).`,
    desc4: `Sport climbing competitions involve a scoring system that combines a climber's performance on predetermined routes with the goal of reaching the highest hold on the wall within a specified time limit. Climbers earn points for successfully completing each route or problem, with higher scores awarded for routes that are more challenging. In case multiple climbers reach the same high point or complete the same route, time can be used as a tiebreaker. The climber with the highest cumulative score across multiple routes or problems is declared the winner. Sport climbing scoring emphasizes a blend of technical skill, strength, and strategy, making it an exciting and dynamic sport to watch and compete in.`,
    desc5: `Sport climbing took its first steps on the Olympic stage at the Buenos Aires Youth Olympic Games in 2018 and made its official Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020. Sport climbing will be in Paris 2024 with a different format: there will be two sets of medals per gender. Instead of competing in a single event that combines boulder, lead and speed, athletes will battle for glory in two events: speed; and boulder and lead combined - with a gold medal on offer in each event.

    desc2: `Surfing is believed to have been practised by fishermen in ancient times in Peru and later, in around 400 AD, across Polynesia.

    James King, who served under explorer Captain James Cook, wrote about surfing in Hawaii after Cook's death in 1779.
    
    Lifeguard George Freeth, born in Hawaii but based in California, became one of the pioneers of modern surfing by cutting a traditional 5m hardwood board to create a more manageable vessel.
    
    He and Duke Kahanamoku, a three-time Olympic swimming champion, helped spread the sport across the United States with Kahanamoku taking it to Australia and advocating the sport be added to the Olympic Games.
    
    A century later, his wish was granted.`,
    desc3: `In competitive surfing, between two and four athletes contest a heat where they have between 20 and 30 minutes to catch the best waves possible.

    Observing usual surfing etiquette, only one surfer can ride a wave at a time with the one closest to the peak having right of way.
    
    The athletes are marked out of 10 for each wave they ride by a panel of judges with only the two best rides - based on the difficulty, variety and type of manoeuvres as well as their power, speed and flow between manoeuvres - counting for each surfer.`,
    desc4: `Surfing competitions employ a scoring system where surfers are judged on the quality and execution of their waves. Judges consider factors like wave selection, the difficulty of maneuvers, style, power, and flow. A panel of judges assigns scores to each ride on a scale, often up to 10 points, with the best waves receiving the highest scores. Surfers typically ride several waves during a heat, with their top-scoring rides counted toward their total. The competitor with the highest combined score at the end of the event or heat advances or wins, emphasizing the skill, creativity, and overall performance of the surfer in riding and controlling the waves.`,
    desc5: `Surfing made its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020 in 2021 with a men's and women's competition each featuring 20 athletes. The athletes used shortboards as per most international competitions.

    It is not to be confused with Marathon (open water) swimming, or artistic swimming at the Games, which are considered separate disciplines.`,
    desc2: `Prehistoric man learned to swim in order to cross rivers and lakes - we know this because cave paintings from the Stone Age depicting swimmers have been found in Egypt. Swimming was also referred to in Greek mythology.

    Swimming was not widely practised until the early 19th century, when the National Swimming Society of Great Britain began to hold competitions. Most early swimmers used the breaststroke, or a form of it.
    
    Based on a stroke used by native South Americans, the first version of the crawl featured a scissor kick. In the late 1880s, an Englishman named Frederick Cavill travelled to the South Seas, where he saw the natives performing a crawl with a flutter kick. Cavill settled in Australia, where he taught the stroke that was to become the famous Australian crawl.`,
    desc3: `Athletes race using one of four strokes - freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly - or all of them in the individual medley (IM) events.

    For freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly and IM events, swimmers start by diving into the water from an elevated starting platform, while backstrokers (who also start the medley relays) begin in the water grasping a starting block.
    
    In relay races, the second, third, and fourth swimmers on a team can only begin their leg of the race once the previous swimmer has touched the wall.
    
    In all races, swimmers start simultaneously at the sound of a tone, and the first individual to touch the wall of the pool after the set distance is the winner. Any swimmer who dives into the pool before the starting signal is disqualified from the race.`,
    desc4: `Swimming competitions use a straightforward scoring system where swimmers race against the clock. The swimmer with the fastest time in their respective event or distance is the winner. In relay races, teams compete, and the fastest overall time determines the winning team. The precision of electronic timing ensures accuracy, with races often measured to hundredths or thousandths of a second, underscoring the sport's emphasis on speed and individual performance in the water.`,
    desc5: `Swimming is one of the oldest Olympic sports, having featured at every modern Olympic Games since Athens 1896. Women began competing at the Stockholm 1912 edition, and the mixed medley relays made their Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020.

    The shortest individual event at the Olympics is the 50m freestyle, while backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly’s shortest race is 100m.
    
    The United States is the most decorated nation with 257 gold medals overall after Tokyo 2020, comfortably ahead of second placed Australia with 69.

    desc1: `Table tennis is a racket-and-ball sport played between two players or doubles teams, similar to tennis but on a table as its name suggests.`,
    desc2: `It is thought that upper-class Victorians in England invented table tennis in the 1880s as a genteel, after-dinner alternative to lawn tennis, using whatever they could find as equipment. A line of books would often be the net, the rounded top of a champagne cork would be the ball and occasionally a cigar box lid would be a racket.

    In 1926, meetings were held in Berlin and London that led to the formation of the International Table Tennis Federation.
    
    It is estimated there are 40 million competitive table tennis players and countless millions playing recreationally, making it the sport with the most participants worldwide.`,
    desc3: `Exact scoring rules may differ from tournament to tournament and even round to round within an event, but generally matches are best-of-5- or best-of-7-games. Within each game, the first player to 11 points with a 2-point cushion takes the game. There are also rules regarding what type of paddles are legal.`,
    desc4: `Table tennis, also known as ping pong, follows a simple scoring system where each game is played to 11 points. To win a game, a player or doubles team must lead by at least 2 points. In the event of a 10-10 tie, the game continues until one side gains a 2-point lead. Matches are typically best-of-five games, although in some competitions, they can be best-of-seven. A point is scored in table tennis when one player fails to return the ball legally within the rules, often due to it hitting the net or going out of bounds, and the opponent is awarded the point. Scoring emphasizes precision, strategy, and quick reflexes in this fast-paced sport.`,
    desc5: `The first World Championships were held in London in 1926, but the sport had to wait a long time before it was given its Olympic debut at the 1988 Seoul Games. Athletes from the People's Republic of China have dominated the sport, winning 32 of 37 gold medals from 1988 to 2021.`

    desc1: `Taekwondo is a traditional Korean martial art practised in 206 countries. that teaches more than physical fighting skills. Taekwondo is a Korean word composed of three parts - 'Tae' meaning foot or to step on, 'Kwon' means to fist or fight and 'Do' refers to the way or discipline.

    In taekwondo, hands and feet can be used to overcome an opponent, but the trademark of the sport is its combination of kick movements.`,
    desc2: `The origin of taekwondo dates back to Korea's Three-Kingdom era (c.50 BC), when Shilla Dynasty warriors, the Hwarang, began to develop a martial art: Taekkyon ("foot-hand").

    During the early 20th century, taekwondo became the dominant form of martial arts practised in Korea. Subsequently, taekwondo was designated as the Korean national martial art to be promoted internationally. In 1973, the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) was founded as the worldwide legitimate governing body of the sport, and the first World Championships were held in Seoul, Korea that year.`,
    desc3: `The rules of taekwondo as outlined by World Taekwondo require a standing bow to the referee, followed by a bow to the opponent, before matches.

    All matches last over three rounds of two minutes each, with a one-minute break between rounds.
    
    The objective of each competitor is to score points by landing blows and kicks on their opponent’s torso or head or to win by knockout.
    
    Blows must be delivered through a straight punching technique using the knuckle part of a tightly clenched fist.
    
    The kicks that count are those delivered using any part of the foot below the ankle bone.
    
    Scoring of a valid point or points is determined primarily using the electronic scoring system installed in the head or trunk protectors, known as the Protector and Scoring Systems (PSS).
    
    Points awarded for punching techniques and additional points awarded for turning kicks are scored by judges using manual scoring devices.`,
    desc4: `Taekwondo scoring is based on a point system where competitors earn points for striking valid target areas of their opponent's body with accurate and forceful kicks and punches. In Olympic-style taekwondo, valid target areas include the head, trunk, and, in some instances, the side of the body. Points are typically awarded by electronic sensors or a panel of judges, and different types of kicks may carry varying point values. Additionally, spinning kicks or kicks to the head can result in higher point scores. The competitor with the most points at the end of the match is declared the winner. Scoring in taekwondo highlights precision, technique, and the ability to land effective strikes while defending against one's opponent.`,
    desc5: `Taekwondo made its debut as a demonstration Olympic sport at the 1988 Seoul Games, and became an official medal sport at the 2000 Sydney Games.

    There are several taekwondo styles. World Taekwondo oversees the Kukkiwon-defined style of taekwondo that is commonly referred to as Olympic taekwondo. Olympic taekwondo allows the use of a very small number of the total number of techniques.`

    title1: `Tennis`,
    title2: `tennis`,
    desc1: `The modern game is played in singles (one player versus another), doubles (teams of two) and mixed doubles (mixed-gender teams) and features differing scoring systems across international events.

    Tennis has a long history, but the birth of the game played today is thought to have taken place in England.`,
    desc2: `The earliest recognisable relative to tennis, as we know it, was "jeu de paume", played in 11th century France. Played in a monastery courtyard, the game used the walls and sloping roofs as part of the court and the palm of the hand to hit the ball.

    By the late 19th century, the popularity of lawn tennis had overtaken croquet in England. For this reason, the All England Croquet Club embraced the sport and designated certain croquet lawns to be used for tennis. It was this natural supply of venues combined with the already existing framework for a racquet game that resulted in the birth of the modern game in England.
    
    In 1913, lawn tennis was becoming increasingly popular worldwide. Therefore, it seemed natural that the existing National Tennis Associations should join forces to ensure the game was uniformly structured. An international conference was held between 12 nations in Paris and the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) was created.`,
    desc3: `Played on a rectangular court lined for singles and doubles, players wield stringed rackets and hit the ball over a regulation tennis net, which divides the court in two.

    Players alternate serving (an overhead motion with the racket) and must hit the ball into the lined service box. They get a first and second serve attempt to start each point, which then is played out by hitting the ball in the lines of the court - either singles or doubles depending on which is being contested.
    
    The ball can bounce only once, and must be hit after the bounce or out of the air, which is known as a volley.`,
    desc4: `Buckle up! Tennis is made up of points, games and sets - which complete a full match.

    A point is a single exchange in which opposing players win by either
    
    Hitting the ball within the lines but out of reach of their opponent;
    Their opponent hitting the ball outside the lines; or
    Their opponent hitting the ball into the net
    To win a "game", players must win four points - but have to do so by a two-point margin. Long ago, tennis adopted a unique scoring system - win one point and you get 15, two you have 30, three is 40. When you win that fourth point, it is game.
    
    Zero is known as love, which - the most prevalent theory claims - comes from the French word l’oeuf, meaning egg - or the shape of zero - which the English mis-heard as... "love."
    
    Reaching four points to win a single game is complicated by needing to do so by a two-point margin. Should two players reach three points (or 40-all) each in a game, it's known as Deuce. From there, a player must establish a two-point margin to win said game.
    
    Games make up a set, and to win a set you must win six games. Most tennis matches are played over best of three sets, though the men play best of five sets at the Grand Slams in singles (and in doubles at Wimbledon, too).`,
    desc5: `Tennis has a long Olympic history but withdrew from the programme after 1924. It did not return as a medal sport until 1988. Professionals are now welcome to compete, and the Olympic competition includes men's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles, the last of which was added in 2012.`

    title2: `trampoline`,
    desc1: `Trampoline is a breathtaking sport that can see athletes bounce over 8 metres in the air while performing a series of complex twists and somersaults. As it is a highly technical sport, trampolinists are required to have an exceptional sense of balance and absolute precision.`,
    desc2: `The first modern trampoline was built by George Nissen and Larry Griswold around 1934 at the University of Iowa. It was initially used to train tumblers and astronauts, and as a training tool to develop and hone acrobatic skills for other sports such as diving, gymnastics and freestyle skiing. People enjoyed the sensation so much, they began to trampoline for sheer fun, and it became popular in its own right.

    Nissen and Griswold envisaged trampolines being used in a variety of new games, although they never grabbed the public’s imagination. In one, called Spaceball, two teams of two on a single trampoline with specially constructed end walls attempted to propel a ball through a middle wall, to hit a target on the other side’s end wall.`,
    desc3: `Trampoline gymnastics utilises four main categories of score: execution, difficulty, horizontal displacement and time of flight.

    World-class competitions include two different routines in the qualifying competition that feature 10 judged elements. In the finals, the gymnasts perform one routine which can be the same or different from qualifying.
    
    The gymnasts also receive an execution score based on how well each element is performed, a time of flight score that calculates the amount of time the gymnast spends in the air and a horizontal displacement score which is based off the gymnast’s ability to stay in the middle of the trampoline.`,
    desc4: `Trampoline scoring is based on a combination of difficulty and execution. In artistic trampoline gymnastics, athletes perform routines that consist of various skills and elements with assigned difficulty values. Judges evaluate the execution and form of each element, deducting points for errors such as incomplete rotations, instability, or poor body alignment. Difficulty scores are added to the execution scores to calculate the total score for each routine. In synchronized trampoline events, the synchronization of movements between two athletes is also a crucial component. The athlete or team with the highest total score, emphasizing a balance of difficulty and flawless execution, is declared the winner.`,
    desc5: `Trampolining made its first appearance at the 2000 Games in Sydney, with men’s and women’s competitions. The number of events (two) has remained unchanged since then.`

    desc1: `Triathlon is a multisport event that combines three disciplines: swimming, cycling and running. In triathlon, competitors compete in a race to the finish line with the first past the tape declared the winner`,
    desc2: `Triathlon was invented in the early 1970s by the San Diego Track Club in the USA as an alternative workout to the rigours of track training. The club's first event consisted of a 10km run, an 8km cycle and a 500m swim. Over the next decade, triathlon’s popularity continued to build, and it soon gained worldwide recognition.`,
    desc3: `The basic rules of triathlon are simple: competitors swim, cycle and run a defined distance in a race to the finish line. An Olympic distance triathlon includes a 1.5km swim, 40km bike ride and 10km run, while sprint distance triathlons are shorter variants of the race. In the World Triathlon Sprint Championships, competitors complete a 750m swim, 20km bike ride and 5km run. On the other end of the scale, Ironman triathlons typically consist of a 3.9km swim, 180.2km bike ride and a 42.2km run.`,
    desc4: `Triathlon scoring is straightforward and time-based, with competitors aiming to complete a race course consisting of swimming, cycling, and running in the shortest time possible. The total time taken to finish all three segments is the primary determinant of the winner. Transition times between the disciplines are included in the overall time, emphasizing not only speed and endurance in each segment but also efficient transitions between them. Triathlons can vary in distance and format, including sprint, Olympic, and Ironman distances, with the winner being the athlete or team with the fastest overall time for the specific race.`,

    title2: `volleyball`,
    desc1: `Volleyball is a sport played on a court by two teams of six players. The game was originally called “Mintonette”, a name derived from the game of badminton, because of its likeness to the sport.`,
    desc2: `William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director and a student at Springfield College, is credited with creating the game of volleyball in 1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts.

    Mintonette (as volleyball was called at the time) was designed to be an indoor pastime that could be enjoyed by older members of the YMCA, and took some of its characteristics from other sports including tennis and handball.
    
    The sport quickly became known as volleyball after an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College). The first rulebooks for the sport were produced in the early 1900s, with the first international federation (Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB)) following in 1947.`,
    desc3: `The premise of volleyball is simple: land the ball in-bounds in the opponent's half of the court without the opponent returning it successfully. Players on a team must use a combination of no more than three contacts to return the ball to the opponent’s side of the net. A point is scored when the ball lands within the court boundaries or when a playing error is made.

    The first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin wins the set, with each match following a best-of-five sets format. If required, a fifth set is played to 15 points (a winning margin of two points is still required).`,
    desc4: `Volleyball scoring follows a rally point system, where a point is scored on every rally, regardless of which team serves. Each set is played to 25 points, with a team needing to win by at least two points. If the match reaches a fifth set (in best-of-five matches), it is played to 15 points. Teams earn a point when the opposing side commits a fault, such as hitting the ball out of bounds or failing to return it within three touches. Scoring emphasizes both offensive and defensive skills, with the team that reaches the required number of points first while maintaining a two-point lead winning the set. The team that wins the majority of sets in a match is declared the overall winner.`,
    desc5: `Volleyball first featured at the Olympic Games as a demonstration sport at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. It made its debut as an official medal sport at the Tokyo 1964 Olympic Games with men’s and women’s team competitions, and has remained on the Olympic programme ever since.`

    title2: `water polo`,
    desc1: `Water polo is a sport played in water between two teams of seven players, including one goalkeeper, all wearing matching coloured caps.

    Players attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into the opposing team's goal, and the team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match.
    
    The sport is typically played in a 3m deep pool measuring 30,6m by 20m for men and 25,6m by 20m for women, so that players cannot touch the bottom.
    
    The key skills of water polo include strategy, strength, speed, endurance, and physicality.`,
    desc2: `Water polo is a tough sport, but when it first began, it was even tougher. It is said that the game originated from Great Britain, where people played rugby in rivers and lakes in the mid-19th Century. Fighting between players was common, if not the norm.

    In 1897, New Yorker Harold Reeder formulated the first American rules for discipline, which were aimed at curbing the sport’s more violent tendencies.
    
    In the early days, the players rode on floating barrels that resembled mock horses, and swung at the ball with mallet-like sticks. This made it similar to equestrian polo, hence its name. In the United States, it was termed "softball water polo" due to the use of an unfilled bladder as a ball.
    
    Water polo was developed in Europe and the United States as two differing sports. Ultimately, the faster, less-dangerous European style predominated, and today this is the form of the game practised universally. It consists of seven-person teams playing four eight-minute periods.`,
    desc3: `Teams are made up of seven players (including one goalkeeper) and have 30 seconds of ball possession to score a goal; if the team does not attack the goal within that time, possession passes to the opposition.

    The team with the most goals at the end of the match is the winner.
    
    Either team may substitute players after a goal is scored, during a time-out, or between periods. During actual play, substitutions must occur through the team's re-entry area (the corner of the pool in front of the team's bench).
    
    The referees whistle two different kinds of fouls: minor (ordinary) fouls and major (personal) fouls. There is no limit to the number of minor fouls a player may commit and if the foul is committed outside the 5m line, the player may take the free throw as a "direct shot" at the goal. Typical minor fouls include impeding free movement of a player who isn’t holding the ball, time wasting in possession of the ball, touching the ball with two hands, letting the shot clock expire, and holding the ball underwater.
    
    However, players can be excluded for 20 seconds if they commit a major foul, and if they are penalised for three major fouls, that player must leave the game and may not return. Major fouls include, holding, sinking, or pulling back a player who doesn’t have the ball, violence, or disrespect.`,
    desc4: `Water polo scoring involves teams attempting to throw the ball into the opposing team's goal while defending their own. Each goal scored is worth one point, and the team with the most goals at the end of the game, typically played in quarters, wins. Matches can have a running clock or stoppage time. Fouls and exclusions result in power plays, where the opposing team has an advantage, and goals scored during power plays count. The intricate combination of offensive strategies, defensive prowess, and physicality in the water highlights the sport's scoring system.`,
    desc5: `Water polo has been part of the Olympic programme since Paris 1900, making it one of the oldest team sports to feature at the Games. The women’s competition was added to the programme at Sydney 2000.

    The earliest editions of the men’s Olympic tournament took place in the Seine river in Paris, with London 1908 the first edition of the Games where water polo took place in a pool.
    
    Hungary has been the most successful nation in the men’s tournament, while the USA has dominated the women’s side.
    
    Italy was the first nation to win both a men’s and women’s Olympic gold medal in water polo.`

    title2: `weightlifting`,
    desc1: `Weightlifting is a sport where athletes lift barbells loaded with weights. Weightlifting tests the strength, power and technique of athletes.`,
    desc2: `Weightlifting has ancient origins. It was practised both by ancient Egyptian and Greek societies. It developed as an international sport primarily in the 19th century, and is one of the few sports to have featured at the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896.

    At the beginning of the century, Austria, Germany and France were the most successful nations. However in the 1950s, the Soviet Union’s weightlifters rose to prominence and stayed there until the 1990s, when China, Turkey, Greece and Iran catapulted to the lead. In the women’s field, China has been dominant since the very beginning.`,
    desc3: `Weightlifters compete in bodyweight categories, or weight classes.

    There are two stages in Olympic weightlifting – the snatch and the clean and jerk.
    
    In snatch weightlifters pick up the barbell and lift it above their head in one singular motion.
    
    In the clean and jerk weightlifters are first required to pick up the barbell and bring it up to their chest (clean). The lifters must then pause and extend their arms and legs to lift it above the head (jerk) with a straight elbow and have to hold it there until a buzzer is sounded.
    
    A weightlifter is given three snatch attempts and three clean and jerk attempts each. A weightlifter’s best attempt at snatch and the clean and jerk are then added up and the one with the highest combined weight lifted is declared the winner.`,
    desc4: `Weightlifting competitions employ a simple scoring system based on the total weight lifted by each competitor in two categories: the snatch and the clean and jerk. In both categories, each lifter has three attempts to successfully lift as much weight as possible. The highest weight successfully lifted in the snatch is added to the highest weight lifted in the clean and jerk to determine the lifter's total. Weightlifters are ranked by their total, and the one with the highest total in their respective weight class is declared the winner. Weightlifting scoring underscores strength, technique, and strategy in lifting the heaviest weights while adhering to strict rules and regulations.`,
    desc5: `Although men’s weightlifting has always been on the programme of the Olympic Games—except for  the 1900, 1908 and 1912 editions—women started to participate only at the 2000 Games in Sydney.

    The Olympic weightlifting programme has evolved greatly over time. Today, weightlifters compete in snatch and clean and jerk, and are placed according to their total combined result. From the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney onwards, men have competed in eight weight categories and women in seven.
    
    Athletes competed in seven men’s and women’s weightlifting classes at Tokyo 2020.`

    title2: `wrestling`,
    desc1: `Wrestling is a sport where two individuals engage or grapple with the aim of throwing or holding their opponent’s shoulders to the ground, or else outscore them during the match.

    At the Olympics there are two variations of wrestling: Freestyle and Greco-Roman. The rules are almost identical, except that in Greco-Roman a wrestler may not attack an opponent below the waist or use his own legs to execute holds.
    
    With the possible exception of athletics, wrestling is recognised as the world’s oldest competitive sport.`,
    desc2: `Cave drawings of wrestlers in France and ancient Egypt have been found dating as far back as 3,000 BC.

    The ancient Greeks used the sport as a way to train soldiers in hand-to-hand combat, and the sport was adopted and evolved by the ancient Romans to remove some of its brutality.`,
    desc3: `In Greco-Roman wrestling, the wrestlers use only their arms and upper bodies to attack, and can only hold those same parts of their opponents.

    As the name suggests, freestyle is a much more open form in which wrestlers also use their legs and may hold opponents above or below the waist.
    
    The most common method of winning bouts in both variations is by points. Wrestlers score points by executing legal holds, throws, takedowns, manoeuvring the opponent to expose his back to the mat for several seconds or by executing reversals.
    
    Reversals involve negating an opponent’s position of advantage from a defensive position and gaining control of the situation.
    
    Moves carry points in accordance to their degree of difficulty and a single move can carry from anywhere between one to five points. High scoring moves, generally arching throws, generally carry the maximum number of points.
    
    Competitors can also gain points if the opponent causes infractions, for example illegal holds, trying to flee a hold rather than defend it, being too negative or by being too passive. These often result in cautions, and the accumulation of three during a bout automatically results in the offending wrestler getting disqualified.
    
    At the end of the six-minute period, the total scores are tallied and the wrestler with more points wins. In case of a tie, the wrestler who has scored the maximum number of points from a single move is declared the winner.
    
    The threshold for a victory by technical fall is a 10-point lead in freestyle, and an 8-point lead in Greco-Roman. A wrestler can also win the match automatically by pinning their opponent.`,
    desc4: `Wrestling scoring is based on a system where competitors earn points for various actions and control of their opponent. Points are awarded for takedowns, reversals, escapes, and exposure of the opponent's back to the mat. In addition to standard points, near falls and pins can lead to match-ending victories. In freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, the match can also be won by accumulating a certain point advantage, typically 10 points, or by gaining two of three periods. The wrestler with the most points or the one who achieves a pin wins the match, highlighting a combination of skill, technique, and strategic positioning.`,
    desc5: `Wrestling was introduced into the ancient Olympics in 708 BC, shortly after the Games' recorded history began, as part of the Pentathlon.

    When the modern Olympic Games resumed in Athens in 1896, wrestling became a focus of the Games. This was because organisers considered it historically significant as Greco-Roman wrestling was deemed to be a reincarnation of ancient Greek and Roman wrestling.
    
    Other than the 1900 Olympics, wrestling has been part of every Summer Olympic programme since the first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896.
    
    In 1904, Olympic officials added freestyle wrestling, commonly known as "catch as catch can", to the programme. This style had far less history and tradition than Greco-Roman but did possess great popularity, having developed into a form of professional entertainment performed at fairs and festivals across Great Britain and the United States.
    
    Freestyle has been contested at every Games other than Stockholm 1912 and Antwerp 1920.
    
    While Greco-Roman remains a sport in which only males compete, women’s freestyle wrestling was introduced to the Olympic programme at Athens 2004, where there were four women’s events on the programme. That was increased to six categories - in line with the men - for the Rio 2016 Games.
    
    The USA and Japan are the most successful still active nations in Olympic wrestling history, with Japan’s women dominating the female division.`
